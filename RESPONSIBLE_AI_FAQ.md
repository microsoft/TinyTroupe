# TinyTroupe: Responsible AI FAQ

## What is TinyTroupe?

*TinyTroupe* is an experimental Python library that allows us to **simulate** people with specific personalities, interests, and goals. These artificial agents - `TinyPerson`s - can listen to us and one another, reply back, and go about their lives in simulated `TinyWorld` environments. This is achieved by leveraging the power of Language Models (LLMs), notably GPT-4, to generate realistic simulated behavior. This allow us to investigate a wide range of **realistic interactions** and **consumer types**, with **highly customizable personas**, under **conditions of our choosing**. The focus is thus on *understanding* human behavior and not on directly *supporting it* (like, say, AI assistants do) -- this results in, among other things, specialized mechanisms and design choices that make sense only in a simulation setting. This has impact for Resonsible AI aspects as described in the rest of this FAQ.

TinyTroupe's approach is programmatic: simulations are specified as Python programs using TinyTroupe elements, and then executed. Inputs to the simulation include
the description of personas (e.g., age, nationality, location, interests, job, etc.) and conversations (e.g., the programmer can "talk" to agents). Outputs
include the thoughts and words of agents, as well as structured extractions from those (e.g., a summary of the conversations).

## What can TinyTroupe do?

TinyTroupe itself is _not_ an Artificial Intelligence (AI) or Machine Learning (ML) model. Instead, it relies on external APIs to power its intelligent capabilities. With that, 
TinyTroupe provide elements mainly to:
  
  - simulate agent personas, including their thoughts and words;
  - simulate environments in which agents interact;
  - extract structured output from simulations, for downstrea use (e.g., a JSON with various items extracted);
  - enrich simulation artifacts, to make them more realistc;
  - provide help with storytelling to make the simulation more interesting.

## What is/are TinyTroupe’s intended use(s)?

TinyTroupe is intended for:
  - analysis of artificial human behavior through simulation;
  - generation of synthetic artifacts through simulation;
  - supplement, rather than replace, human insight generation;
  - allow the research of various possibilities of computational cognitive architectures, which might or might not reflect actual human cognition.
  
TinyTroupe IS NOT intended for:
  - direct interaction with users. Rather, programmers relying on TinyTroupe for products should create their own layer of responsible AI to ensure simulation results are suitable.
  - policy or any consequential decision making. Rather, any decision made using TinyTroupe simulations should consider that the simulation results might not reflect reality and as such must be used very carefully for anything that has real world impact.

## How was TinyTroupe evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

TinyTroupe was evaluated through various use cases, part of which are provided as examples in the library. It is suitable to use under those scenarios to the extent that
the demonstrations show. Anything beyond that remains research and experimental work. Extensive unit and scenario testing are also part of the library.


## What are the limitations of TinyTroupe? How can users minimize the impact of TinyTroupe’s limitations when using the system?

TinyTroupe HAS NOT being shown to match real human behavior, and therefore any such possibility reamains mere research or experimental investigation.
Though not observed in our various tests, TinyTroupe HAS the theoretical potential of generating output that can be considered malicious. The reason for this is that
one important theoretical use case for TinyTroupe is the validation of **other** AI systems against such malicious outputs, so it nothing restricts it from simulating
bad actors. THEREFORE, programmers using TinyTroupe to create their own products or service on top of it MUST provide their own Responsible AI safeguards,
since TinyTroupe itself is not designed to constrain outputs in this manner. This is THE SAME CASE for any other foundational LLM library such as LangChain or Semantic Kernel,
which, just like TinyTroupe, are mere TOOLS that should be used with care.

## What operational factors and settings allow for effective and responsible use of TinyTroupe?

TinyTroupe can be used responsibly by:
  - using external model APIs that themselves provide safety mechanisms (e.g., Azure OpenAI provide extensive resources to that end).
  - providing suitable persona descriptions (i.e., non-malicious personas);
  - do not induce simulation stories or agent behavior for the generation of malicious content. If this is done, be fully aware that THE ONLY allowed use for that is the validadion of other AI
    systems agains such undesirable outputs.
  - DO NOT allowing simulations to control real-world mechanisms, unless appropriate damange control mechanisms are in place to prevent actual harm from happening.
  - if you use TinyTroupe to power your own product or service, YOU MUST provide your own Responsible AI safeguards, such as output verification.
