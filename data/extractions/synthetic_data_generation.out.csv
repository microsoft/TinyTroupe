USER,"Get some work done together, help each other."
Marina Ellsworth,"Sounds good — I’m up for a focused co-working session. Quick proposal: a 90‑minute block (or 2×45 Pomodoros) with this agenda: 1) pick 1–2 priority tasks and clarify the desired outcome, 2) pair on the highest‑priority/hardest item for the first 45–60 minutes, 3) 10–15 minute check‑in to capture decisions and next steps. I can help draft requirements, map acceptance criteria, clean or outline data steps, review text, or sketch next actions. What would you like to work on first, and do you prefer 90 minutes or two 45‑minute rounds? If that works, I’ll open a shared doc and set a timer."
Natalia Carmichael,"Yes — I'd love to. First we will do a quick 5-minute check-in to agree priorities. Then we will do a focused work block (I suggest 25 minutes with a 5-minute break, then a second 25-minute block) — that usually helps me stay on task. My priorities right now are grading a stack of lab reports and finalising a Monday diffusion/osmosis lesson; either of those would be great to tackle together. I can open a shared Google Doc or my Canvas folder and share the rubric so we can work in parallel. Does that plan suit you? Which task would you prefer to start with, and do you prefer 25/5 Pomodoros or a single 50-minute block?"
Marina Ellsworth,"Sounds great — I like the 5‑minute check‑in + 25/5/25 rhythm. I suggest we start with finalizing your Monday diffusion/osmosis lesson (time‑sensitive), unless you’d rather begin with the grading stack. Proposed plan for the first 25‑minute block (I can take the lead drafting these):

1) Confirm 1–2 clear learning objectives for Monday (what students should be able to DO). 
2) Sketch a 15–20 minute core activity (hands‑on demo or guided simulation) and a 5‑minute exit ticket question to assess learning. 
3) Make a short materials/tech checklist and a note about accessibility/accommodations. 
4) Jot a very brief teacher script/slide notes and any quick formative assessment items.

After the first 25 minutes we’ll take the 5‑minute break, then use the second 25‑minute block to refine the activity, turn the exit ticket into an assessment item, or switch to grading if you prefer.

Practicals: do you want me to open a Google Doc, or will you share a Canvas page? If Google Doc works, I can create an outline and paste in a quick template; if you prefer Canvas, please share the link. Once you share, I’ll start a 5‑minute check‑in (confirm the single priority and roles) and then start the first 25‑minute timer."
Natalia Carmichael,"Lovely — that plan suits me. First we will do a 90-minute block made of two focused 45-minute rounds, then a 10–15 minute check-in to capture decisions and next steps. My suggestion for priorities: start with grading the lab reports (they're the most urgent), then use the second 45 to finalise Monday's diffusion/osmosis lesson. Acceptance criteria so we're aligned: for grading, I'll aim for a first-pass on ~20 reports with my three-bullet feedback structure (praise, one improvement, next step) or at least complete the first pass on the stack and flag any tricky ones; for the lesson, I'd like finished slides, a materials list, and a short exit ticket uploaded to Canvas. Could you open a shared Google Doc and set a 45-minute timer to start? I can paste my rubric from Canvas into the doc and work in parallel — would you prefer to draft comments while I skim for trends, or should we split by batches and swap responsibility after the first round?"
Marina Ellsworth,"That plan sounds good — I can do the Google Doc and kick off the first 45-minute timer. My suggested workflow to keep us coordinated: 1) You paste the rubric at the top of the doc and flag any reports you already see as tricky. 2) I’ll draft the three-bullet feedback (praise, one improvement, next step) for roughly the first ~10 reports while you skim for trends and paste any global notes. 3) At the 45-minute mark we’ll do a quick 3–5 minute check-in in the doc: capture tricky ones, swap batches if needed, or finish the pass. That should get you a solid first pass on the stack; if the pile is larger we can adjust in the midpoint. I’ll create the doc now and share the link here — do you want me to name the doc “Lab grading — first pass [date]” and start the timer when you confirm? "
Natalia Carmichael,"Lovely — the 25/5/25 rhythm suits me and I agree we should start with the Monday diffusion/osmosis lesson. First, can you open a Google Doc and share the link? I’ll paste the Canvas rubric into it so we have the success criteria visible. Roles for the first 25-minute block: please take the lead drafting the 15–20 minute core activity (hands-on demo or guided simulation) and a provisional materials/tech checklist; I’ll draft 1–2 clear learning objectives, note accessibility/accommodations, and add a brief teacher script/slide notes. Acceptance criteria for the first 25: agreed learning objectives, a sketched core activity, and a materials checklist (flag any missing or tricky supplies). Then in the second 25-minute block I’ll turn the exit ticket into a formative assessment item and assemble 3–6 slides + a short teacher script while you refine the activity and check logistics. Finally, we’ll use the short check-in after both blocks to capture decisions and upload the exit ticket/slides to Canvas. Ready for you to open the Doc and start a 5-minute check-in/timer?"
Marina Ellsworth,"Ready — I will open a Google Doc now and share the link here. I'll name it ""Diffusion_Osmosis_Monday_2026-01-25"" and paste a short outline that includes: 1) a 5-minute check-in note, 2) roles (I draft the 15–20-minute core activity + materials/tech checklist; you draft 1–2 learning objectives, accessibility notes, and teacher script), 3) acceptance criteria for the first 25 (agreed objectives, sketched core activity, materials checklist), and 4) the 25/5/25 timer plan. After I post the link, I’ll start the 5-minute check-in timer. Do you want me to give you edit access (preferred) or view-only? Any quick notes to add before I create the doc?"
Natalia Carmichael,"Lovely — that sounds perfect. Yes, please name the doc ""Lab grading u000du000a— first pass 2026-01-25"" (or similar) and share the link when it's ready; start the timer when you confirm. First, I'll paste the Canvas rubric at the top and flag any reports I already see as tricky. I'll skim for trends while you draft the three-bullet feedback for the first ~10 reports (praise, one improvement, next step). Acceptance criteria for this first pass: aim to complete a first-pass on the stack (rough target ~20 reports) with three-bullet feedback or at least finish the portion we agree on and flag tricky ones for a second pass. One quick preference question: do you want the three-bullet comments inline beneath each report, or in a separate 'Feedback' column so we can filter/sort? Either is fine with me — tell me which you prefer and then start the timer."
Marina Ellsworth,"Thanks — I prefer a separate 'Feedback' column (easier to filter/sort and export). I'll create a shared doc now titled ""Lab grading u00096u00096 first pass 2026-01-25"" (or I can make a Google Sheet if you want strict columns). Proposed structure: Report ID | Student name | Link to report | Feedback (three bullets: praise, one improvement, next step) | Flag (tricky) | Notes. Workflow: you paste the Canvas rubric at the top and flag any tricky ones; I'll take roughly the first ~10 reports and draft the three-bullet feedback in the Feedback column while you skim for trends. At the 45-minute mark we'll do a 3–5 minute check-in and swap or continue as needed. Quick question: do you want me to also add inline comments directly in the original reports, or keep feedback only in the table to avoid duplication? If that sounds good, confirm whether you prefer a Doc (table) or a Sheet, paste the rubric, and I will start the timer as soon as you say go and give me edit access."
Natalia Carmichael,"Lovely — please give me edit access (that will be easiest). The document name you suggested is fine. Quick notes: First, paste the Canvas rubric at the top and I will add my copy as well so success criteria are visible. Then, could you add a short 'Feedback' column (rather than burying comments inline) so we can sort and filter the three-bullet feedback easily? Please also flag any reports you already think are tricky and list any materials that might need department approval or a substitute. Finally, start the 5-minute check-in timer when you share the link and I’ll join and paste my accessibility notes and learning-objective suggestions. Ready when you are — thank you!"
