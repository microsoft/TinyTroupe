    "title": "Halcyon Air \u2014 Initial Recovery & Regulator/Lender Outreach Report (Draft)",
    "content": "# Executive Summary\nHalcyon Air is experiencing cascading operational disruption driven by three simultaneous stressors: a cluster of pilot sickness cases reducing crew availability, two aircraft on ground (AOG) awaiting parts/MRO work, and tightening lender covenants that constrain cash flexibility. Compounding these issues are market-specific FX constraints that limit our ability to make short-notice wet-lease payments in some countries.\n\nImmediate objective: restore and maintain a minimum safe scheduled service across revenue-critical routes within 10 days while stabilizing liquidity and preserving regulator and lessor confidence. This document sets out: an expanded diagnosis, prioritized immediate actions for 0\u201310 days, medium-term stabilizers for 10\u201330 days, detailed governance with named owners and deadlines, concrete data requirements and templates, sample communications (regulator/lender/passengers/staff), decision matrices (wet-lease scoring, crew triage), a cash/covenant scenario analysis, detailed risk register and mitigations, and appendices with checklists and upload templates to enable rapid execution.\n\nKey measurable goals (next 72 hours)\n- Upload and validate critical diagnostic data (fleet sheet, crew roster, active schedule) \u2014 T+1 hour.\n- Convene ops war-room and agree minimum-service 10-day schedule \u2014 T+60\u201390 minutes.\n- Provide regulator pre-call brief and make initial outreach \u2014 T+2\u20133 hours.\n- Produce a shortlist of up to five wet-lease providers with full terms \u2014 T+12 hours.\n- Deliver initial cash/covenant scenarios to lenders and internal stakeholders \u2014 T+4 hours.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate situation (as of this draft \u2014 snapshot)\n- Two AOG aircraft (tail numbers: placeholder entries until Oscar uploads full details). Current action: MRO notified; diagnostic reports in progress. ETA for parts and return-to-service pending parts manifest and MRO labor queue.\n- Significant crew unavailability: multiple pilots/crew reporting sickness across hubs. Extent unknown \u2014 crew roster and last-flight/currency details required immediately to model reserve capacity and compliance with flight/duty time regulations.\n- Tight lender covenants: several covenant thresholds are close to trigger windows, particularly liquidity and consolidated leverage covenants. Wet-lease expense could materially increase near-term cash outflow.\n- FX/payment constraints: in at least two operating markets, local banking restrictions delay same-day cross-border transfers; some wet-lease providers insist on USD/EUR payments.\n\nCurrent known assumptions (to be validated)\n- Traffic demand for core routes remains at ~70\u201385% of seasonal baseline.\n- Passengers are likely to seek alternatives if cancellations exceed 6\u201312 hours without proactive communication/compensation.\n- No safety incidents have occurred; priority remains safety-first.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate actions taken / proposed (0\u201324 hours) \u2014 expanded and detailed\nBelow is a prioritized action roster with clear owners, deliverables, deadlines and escalation paths.\n\n1) Convene ops war-room (30\u201390 minutes)\n   - Owner: Lisa Carter to schedule; facilitator: Marcos; required attendees: Ops lead (Halcyon), Oscar (Operations), Sara (Commercial/Sourcing), Alex (Finance), Crew manager(s), MRO liaison, Customer Care lead.\n   - Deliverable: decision memo capturing minimum-service routes, aircraft allocations (internal vs wet-lease), crew assignments, communications triggers.\n   - Target: convene within 60 minutes preferred; 90 minutes alternate.\n   - War-room modality: hybrid (video + dedicated Slack/Teams channel + shared Google Drive/SharePoint folder).

Safety-first regulator engagement (Owner: Lisa)\n   - Objective: Keep the regulator fully informed; obtain specific, time-boxed flexibility only where strictly necessary; avoid requests that would undermine safety oversight.\n   - Pre-call deliverables:\n     - One-page summary (situation, immediate actions, 10-day remediation plan, ask).\n     - Regulator call script and FAQ (Appendix contains script and anticipated Q&A).\n   - Recommended asks (narrow and specific, examples):\n     - Short-term conditional relief on slot return deadlines for affected flights while RFS committed.\n     - Agreement on acceptable substitution aircraft types on certain routes pending passenger notification and safety compliance.\n     - Confirmation on any additional oversight requirements for wet-leased aircraft (e.g., need for specific validations or additional crew checks).\n   - During call:\n     - Keep Halcyon ops lead on the line; have MRO and safety officer available to answer technical questions.\n     - Log the call with time stamp, attendees, commitments, and next steps.\n   - Post-call:\n     - Upload regulator confirmation/notes and any formal approvals to Halcyon folder.\n     - Share one-page update to lenders and internal execs.\n\nB. War-room + triage (Owner: Marcos/Oscar; facilitation: Lisa)\n   - Purpose: Rapid decision-making on which flights to operate, wet-lease, or suspend; allocate staff; and assign communications.\n   - Suggested war-room agenda (30\u201390 minutes):\n     - 0\u20135 min: Opening, objectives, attendees and roles.\n     - 5\u201320 min: Core data review \u2014 fleet sheet, crew roster, priority routes.\n     - 20\u201340 min: Cash & covenant senior summary and wet-lease options.\n     - 40\u201360 min: Decisions on minimum-service schedule (10-day window): list flights to run and method (internal/wet-lease/suspend).\n     - 60\u201375 min: Communications plan assignment: regulator, lenders, customers, staff, lessors.\n     - 75\u201390 min: Execution checklist and next steps; confirm decision log entries and responsible owners.\n   - Outputs:\n     - Signed decision memo with time-stamped approvals.\n     - Task assignments in project tracker with deadlines.\n\nC. Wet-lease procurement & FX mitigation (Owner: Sara)\n   - Procurement approach:\n     - Pre-qualify providers that can deploy within 24\u201372 hours.\n     - Favor providers that accept local currency or staged payments (down payment + daily true-up) to reduce FX stress.\n     - Include termination provisions and daily/hourly caps to cap downside.\n     - Shorten procurement cycle by using standard Halcyon Master Wet-Lease Appendix (legal to prepare quick-sign addendum).\n   - Wet-lease scoring matrix (sample weights):\n     - Availability (30%), Price (25%), Currency/payment flexibility (15%), Ferry time (10%), Regulatory readiness (10%), Crew included (10%).\n     - Use attached template to rank providers and justify selection.\n\nD. Cash & covenant management (Owner: Alex with Lisa)\n   - Scenario modelling:\n     - Scenario A \u2014 Internal triage only: costs limited to crew adjustments and minor third-party spend. Projected 10-day burn = baseline + X.\n     - Scenario B \u2014 Wet-lease assisted: includes top 2 wet-lease options for high-priority routes; 10\u201330 day cash impact modeled.\n     - Scenario C \u2014 Pessimistic: both AOGs out for extended period, high wet-lease exposure and elevated passenger compensation.\n   - Lender communications:\n     - Prepare a concise one-page lender summary (see Appendix sample) showing current liquidity, the mitigation plan, and an ask (e.g., covenant waiver or forbearance for a defined period).\n     - Provide supporting Excel workbook with cash flows and covenant calculation mechanics for lender review.\n   - Negotiation posture:\n     - Keep requests time-bound and backed by operational milestones (e.g., \u201cIf we can re-introduce 70% of Tier 1 routes within 10 days, covenant relief no longer required.\u201d).\n\n---\n\n## Medium-term stabilizers (10\u201330 days) \u2014 prioritized interventions\n- Repair & return of AOG aircraft (Owner: Oscar)\n  - Coordinate 24/7 with MROs; request prioritized work packs; consider two-shift coverage to compress RFS where economically justified.\n  - Consider sourcing parts from alternate vendors or cannibalizing a grounded non-revenue aircraft if contractual/lessor approvals permit (legal/lessor advice required).\n\n- Rebalance network and frequency (Owner: Alex + Halcyon network team)\n  - Re-assess demand patterns; cut low-yield frequencies temporarily; consolidate flows to protect aircraft utilization and margins.\n  - Implement conditional schedule changes with partner carriers and adjust code-share commitments.\n\n- Cost-to-serve savings and temporary revenue tactics (Owner: Halcyon finance + Lisa)\n  - Immediate discretionary spend freeze (capex paused, vendor non-essential payments deferred where possible).\n  - Temporary product/pricing adjustments (lower add-on allowances or change fees for rebooking) designed to preserve cash short-term while minimizing passenger disruption.\n\n- Crew recency & hiring (Owner: Crew Manager + HR)\n  - Initiate targeted short-term contract pilot hiring in markets with supply; assess use of training centers for accelerated recency refresh where safe and regulator-permitted.\n\n- Contract and legal reviews (Owner: Legal)\n  - Review wet-lease agreements, lessor covenants, and existing insurance coverage for war-risk, contingencies, and third-party liabilities.\n\n---\n\n## Governance, milestones & owners (clear timeline and escalation matrix)\nBelow is an expanded timeline with inputs, outputs, owners and escalation.\n\nHigh-level milestone table\n\n| Milestone | Owner | Deadline | Output |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Upload fleet sheet, crew roster, active schedule | Oscar | T+1 hour | Completed CSV/PDF uploads |\n| Convene ops war-room | Lisa (schedule);
