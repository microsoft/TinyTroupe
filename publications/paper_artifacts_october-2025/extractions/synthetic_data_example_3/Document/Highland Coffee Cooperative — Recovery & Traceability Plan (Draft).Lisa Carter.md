# Executive summary

Highland Coffee Cooperative (1,200 smallholders) is facing an urgent commercial and quality crisis: multiple buyer rejections for off-grade shipments with suspected fungal contamination. Underlying drivers include severe drought (reducing ambient drying effectiveness), inconsistent post-harvest handling, weak lot-level traceability, and lack of working capital to implement corrective measures quickly. Buyers require rapid, credible evidence that corrective actions are underway and that future lots can meet moisture and mycotoxin standards. The client has requested a bankable recovery and traceability program deliverable within five weeks.

This document sets out a detailed, actionable, phased five-week program that balances the immediate need to reassure buyers (speed and evidence) with low-capex, scalable interventions for farmers that reduce moisture and toxin risk. The program emphasizes (1) rapid QA and chain-of-custody evidence, (2) a three-site pilot deploying low-cost drying/processing interventions, (3) a minimal QR-based traceability pilot tied to lab results, and (4) near-term financing options to enable quick farmer uptake. Deliverables are designed to be acceptable to buyers and lenders (clear lab reports, chain-of-custody documentation, discrete lot-level traceability records).

Primary objectives
- Rapidly establish QA evidence to address buyer concerns — credible, accredited lab results with chain-of-custody and lot-level linkage.
- Pilot low-capex drying and handling interventions to reduce moisture and toxin risk and quantify cost-per-farmer and time-to-stabilization.
- Implement a minimal, pragmatic traceability pilot (QR-based) to restore buyer confidence and demonstrate lot-level traceability linking farmer → lot → drying site → lab result.
- Identify and secure short-term working capital (buyer advances, emergency grants, micro-loans) to fund urgent interventions and procurement.

Key owners and responsibilities
- Lisa Carter — Buyer & regulator communications; packaging of assurance documents; final buyer presentations; overall program lead for week 0–5.
- Marcos Almeida — Farmer engagement lead; sampling & chain-of-custody protocols; training delivery; farmer lists & field coordination.
- Oscar (surname TBD) — Drying kit design, BOM, procurement, deployment, monitoring of pilot drying solutions.
- Alex (surname TBD) — Traceability system design, QR mapping and analytics, pilot dashboard and data ingestion.
- Sara (surname TBD) — Funding identification and certification fast-track; finance roadmap; liaison with buyers and potential donors.
- Legal team (internal/external) — Draft buyer assurance/acceptance language, acceptable lab/certificate formats, review of buyer advance agreements.

Target outcomes within five weeks
- Credible buyer assurance packet containing: summarized accredited lab evidence, chain-of-custody records, QR-traceable lot records for pilot lots, and a concise implementation roadmap for scale-up and financing.
- Demonstrated reduction in moisture and toxin risk on pilot lots (target: drying to <12% moisture; toxin levels within buyer thresholds or clear trend of reduction).
- A bankable scale-up plan (procurement options, financing needs, certification pathway) ready for buyers or lenders to review.

# Situation overview (expanded)

Symptoms observed
- Multiple buyer rejections of recent shipments due to off-grade quality. Buyers flagged "suspected fungal contamination" and elevated moisture readings in sampled lots.
- Rejection notices include instances where buyer-contracted lab screening detected higher-than-expected aflatoxin indicators or moisture above accepted thresholds (buyer thresholds typically ≤11–12% moisture; country/regulatory aflatoxin limits vary — commonly 5–10 ppb for some markets).

Contributing factors (detailed)
- Drought and higher ambient humidity swings: Irregular sunny periods and high night-time humidity increase drying time and risk of re-wetting overnight.
- Inconsistent drying and packing practices: Coffee parchment/green beans left on ground or low, wet, single-layer beds; inconsistent turning; wet lots stored in non-ventilated sacks.
- Weak lot-level traceability: Harvests aggregated early, lacking lot IDs that survive through drying → storage → export, preventing targeted QA or segmentation of rejections.
- No working capital at farm level: Farmers cannot invest in improved drying materials or pay for transport to drying hubs; limited willingness to delay sale for better drying due to cash needs.

Time pressure
- Buyers have requested rapid reassurance and evidence; the client needs a bankable plan within five weeks to prevent suspended contracts and to reopen trade lanes.

Key constraints
- Budget: minimal immediate funds available; dependence on buyer advances, emergency grants, or rapid micro-lending.
- Labor/time: farmers busy with harvest; training must be concise and practical.
- Logistics: remote sites with variable road access; sample transport needs to maintain chain-of-custody and preserve sample integrity.

# Pilot design summary (expanded)

Sites
- Selection rationale: one site with optimal drying conditions (ample sun, low night humidity, good ventilation), one representing typical current cooperative practices, and one worst-case drought-exposed site (limited sun, high rewet risk).
- Proposed pilot farmer counts: target 10–20 farmers/site to give statistical spread (total pilot farmers 30–60).

Kit concepts (design, capacity, costs)

Table: Kit concepts summary (indicative prices & throughput)

| Concept | Description | Typical capacity/day (kg parchment) | Approx. unit cost (USD) | Key benefits | Key limitations |
|---------|-------------|-------------------------------------:|-------------------------:|--------------|-----------------|
| A | Raised solar drying beds (simple, low-capex) — timber/metal frame + mesh + cover | 30–80 kg/day (single bed) | $60–120 per bed | Very low capex; passive; easy to construct locally | Slower drying; requires sun & active turning |
| B | Covered solar rack / simple tunnel dryer (low-cost cover over racks; ventilation) | 80–150 kg/day | $250–400 | Faster than A; better protection from rewetting; moderate cost | Requires some materials & construction skill |
| C | Small low-energy forced-air hub dryer (electric or biomass-fan assisted) | 200–500 kg/day (hub dryer serving multiple farmers) | $1,200–3,000 (includes fan, motor, heat source) | Fast, uniform drying; usable in variable weather | Higher capex; needs power/fuel & operator |

Notes on costing
- Unit costs above are indicative and include locally-sourced materials and modest labor. Oscar to provide locally adjusted BOM and cost estimates per three kit options for procurement.
- Cost-per-farmer depends on model: individual kit per farmer vs shared hub model. Shared hub dryers (Concept C) often result in lower per-farmer cost for communities with collective governance.

Metrics to report (with definitions)
- Daily moisture profile (green/cleaned beans pre-storage): measure with calibrated moisture meter (oven-dry method baseline for lab verification). Target <12% for export; some buyers request ≤11%.
- Baseline and weekly lab toxin levels: aflatoxin (B1, B2, G1, G2) total and ochratoxin A (where regionally relevant). Report in ppb with LOQ and method.
- Reject-rate delta: % of lots rejected pre-pilot vs during pilot (pilot lots only).
- Cost-per-farmer: total pilot cost allocation / number of participating farmers (include amortized kit cost if applicable).
- Time-to-stabilization: days from kit deployment to consistent compliant moisture readings for a lot.

QA approach (chain-of-custody & lab)
- Chain-of-custody logs for each sample from field collection → transport → lab receipt. Each sample labeled with unique Sample ID (linked to QR lot ID).
- Accredited labs: use labs with national/international accreditation (ISO/IEC 17025 preferred). For rapid timelines, use local accredited labs with short turnaround and confirm confirmatory quant methods.
- Lab results must include: sample ID, method (e.g., HPLC-FLD, LC-MS/MS), LOQ, LOD, result (ppb), analyst, date/time, and lab accreditation statement.

# Traceability prototype (QR) — detailed design

Pilot data schema (fields and data types)
- farmer_id (string): Cooperative-assigned unique ID (e.g., HCC-0001)
- lot_id (string): Lot identifier (e.g., HCC-2025-06-L01)
- harvest_date (date): Date or date range of harvest
- GPS_lat (decimal)
- GPS_long (decimal)

- Data ingestion and short-term hosting: Alex (sets up hosting and read-only views).
- Lab linkage update: Marcos uploads lab certificates and marks sample IDs as tested.
- Buyer access: Lisa circulates direct links to buyer contacts; buyers can scan a sample QR and verify uploaded certificate.

Minimum-viable-technical (MVT) requirements
- Mobile capture form (Google Form/KoBoToolbox/Ona) with offline capabilities where necessary.
- QR code generator and simple labeling (sticker printing or pre-printed QR slips).
- Secure storage for lab certificates (project folder with controlled access).
- Dashboard page summarizing pilot status with per-lot links.

# Sampling SOP & chain-of-custody — (operational templates)

Sampling strategy
- Purpose: get representative samples for each lot to detect moisture and toxin indicators.
- Sample size (field): For parchment/green coffee, take composite samples of ~1 kg composed of 100–200 g sub-samples pulled from several sacks or positions across the lot.
- Tools required: sterile sample bags, permanent marker, sample labels with unique Sample ID, gloves, cooler box for transport if high ambient heat, sample logbook or digital form.

Sample labeling convention
- Sample ID format: HCC-YYMMDD-LOC-SEQ (e.g., HCC-251003-DS03-001)
- Physical label fields: Sample ID, farmer_id, lot_id, date/time sampled, sampler name, moisture reading at sampling, signature.

Chain-of-custody log (table template)
| Sample ID | Collected by | Farmer ID | Lot ID | Date/Time collected | Moisture (%) field meter | Transfer to (person/vehicle) | Date/Time transfer | Lab received (date/time) | Lab sample ID |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|--------|---------------------|--------------------------:|-----------------------------|--------------------:|-------------------------:|--------------:|
| HCC-251003-DS03-001 | J. Mwangi | HCC-0103 | L01 | 2025-10-03 08:30 | 11.2 | Transporter A | 2025-10-03 10:00 | 2025-10-03 13:00 | LAB-000345 |

Sample handling notes
- Avoid cross-contamination: use gloves, seal bags, label at time of collection.
- Transport: if sample storage >24 hours, keep dry and if feasible, cool.
- Record every handover on CoC log with signatures.

Lab submission checklist
- Completed chain-of-custody form.
- Copies of farmer/lot metadata (farmer_id, lot_id, GPS).
- Indicate requested analyses and turnaround expectation (standard vs expedited).
- Payment instructions or prearranged billing (if necessary).

# Laboratories & testing plan

Recommended tests and rationale
- Moisture (oven-dry method, official/gravimetric): use as confirmation of field meter readings. LOQ: N/A; provide exact % moisture.
- Aflatoxin quantification (LC-MS/MS or HPLC-FLD after immunoaffinity clean-up): recommended for quantifying B1/B2/G1/G2. LOQ typically 0.5–1 ppb depending on lab.
- Ochratoxin A (if buyer/regional risk): HPLC-FLD or LC-MS/MS; LOQ typically 0.5–1 ppb.
- Rapid screening options (ELISA-based lateral flow devices): for quick triage but require confirmatory testing at accredited lab.

Sample testing plan (pilot)
- Baseline: one composite sample per pilot lot (immediate).
- Weekly during pilot: one composite per site (pooling recommended if many small lots), plus targeted re-tests of lots with elevated readings.
- Confirmatory: any sample exceeding buyer thresholds should trigger confirmatory testing (same or different accredited lab) and review of handling.

Lab selection guidance
- Prioritize local accredited labs (ISO/IEC 17025) with quick turnaround (24–72h for priority samples).
- Where local labs lack capacity, consider shipping to reputable regional labs — factor in transport time.
- Request labs to include method, LOQ, LOD, analyst signature, and accreditation statement on certificates.

Typical costs (indicative)
- Moisture (oven): $10–20 / sample
- Aflatoxin quantitative: $50–120 / sample (depends on method & lab)
- Ochratoxin A quantitative: $60–120 / sample
- Rapid screening (lateral flow): $8–20 / test

Turnaround planning
- For buyer assurance, target a 72h turnaround for initial set of critical samples. If not possible, use rapid screening to provide immediate indicators, followed by full quantification.

---

# Procurement checklist (instant needs)

Immediate procurement items
- Moisture meters (calibrated): 3–6 units (one per site + backup).
- Sample bags (sterile, sealable): ~100.
- QR stickers and label printer or pre-printed labels.
- Materials for Kit A/B/C as per BOM.
- Personal protective equipment (gloves, markers, permanent label pens).
- Data collection devices (smartphone/tablet) for lead monitors (if available).

Procurement lead times (indicative)
- Local sourcing: 1–7 days for basic materials (wood, mesh, tarpaulin).
- Equipment requiring import (e.g., small fans for hub dryer): 7–21 days.
- Label printers & pre-printed QR labels: 3–10 days depending on vendor.

Procurement approval triggers
- If buyer advance or grant approved: begin procurement within 24–48h.
- If no immediate funds: prioritize lowest-cost, locally-constructable Kit A deployments.

---

# Financing options (shortlist & pathways)

1) Buyer advance (preferred for speed)
- Structure: Buyer provides partial payment for future shipments in exchange for conditional supply obligations, use of funds for designated capex (drying kits), and documented chain-of-custody and pilot evidence.
- Typical terms: 20–50% advance against expected shipment value; funds disbursed to cooperative account; use restricted per agreement.
- Timeline: negotiation 48–72h if buyer willing; disbursement 7–14 days.

2) Micro-finance / working capital loans
- Local rural finance institutions or cooperative credit union.
- Typical terms: short-term (30–90 days), interest 2–8% monthly depending on lender.
- Timeline: application 3–7 days, disbursement 7–14 days (may be slower).

3) Emergency grants / donor mini-grants
- Potential sources: local agriculture ministry emergency funds, coffee buyer corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds, NGO support (e.g., development partners).
- Typical grant size: $2k–$15k.
- Timeline: rapid-response windows vary; some donors can disburse within 2–4 weeks.

4) Supplier credit / equipment lease
- Vendor provides dryer equipment on lease/repayment plan, repayable after shipment receipts.
- Timeline: negotiation 1–2 weeks; may require guarantee.

Recommended short-term approach
- Combine buyer advance for immediate procurement with a local micro-loan for bridge funding if necessary, while applying for small donor grants for wider scale-up.

Sara to provide 2–3 named options with contact points and model term sheets within 72 hours.

# Certification & compliance fast-track options

Potential certification pathways (for buyer acceptance)
- Traceability proof and lab evidence can be sufficient for temporary buyer acceptance while full certification processes (e.g., Rainforest Alliance, Fairtrade) are longer.
- For rapid assurance, pursue:
  - Accredited lab certificates (ISO/IEC 17025) — immediate
  - Temporary buyer-specific acceptance clauses (legal) — immediate
  - Fast-track documentation for sustainability certificates (initial paperwork and payment) — longer-term (months)
- Fast-track timeline examples:
  - Lab certificates: immediate to 72 hours per sample.
  - Traceability demonstration (QR pilot): immediate to 2 weeks for pilot evidence.
  - Rainforest Alliance / 3rd-party audit: 3–6 months (not immediate).

Recommendation
- Use lab evidence plus QR traceability and buyer-signed acceptance language for immediate resumption of trade. Parallelly, initiate certification processes as medium-term resilience steps.

# Risks & mitigations (expanded risk matrix)

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation | Contingency budget estimate |
|------|-----------:|-------:|-----------|----------------------------:|
| Slow lab turnaround | Medium-High | High (delays buyer assurance) | Prioritize local accredited labs, reduce sample volume initially, use rapid screening for immediate signals | $500–$1,500 (expedited testing fees) |
| Farmers unwilling to adopt new kits | Medium | Medium | Pre-select willing farmers; provide short-term incentives (advances, materials); hands-on training | $1,000 (small incentives) |
| Traceability gaps or data loss | Medium | High | Use pilot subset, ensure backup paper records, verify QR links before buyer release | $200 (data storage & labeling) |
| Insufficient funds to procure kits | High | High | Negotiate buyer advance or quick donor support; prioritize low-capex Kit A for immediate rollout | $5,000 (bridge financing) |
| Weather rewet events during pilot | High (given drought/wet cycles) | Medium-High | Provide tarpaulin covers, covered racks, schedule drying at times of lower humidity, use forced-air hub if critical | $600 (covers & protective materials) |
| Operational misuse of equipment | Medium | Medium | Focused practical training and buddy system; routine checks | $300 (follow-up visits) |

Total contingency (recommended short-term reserve): $8,000–$12,000 to cover expedited testing, small incentives, protective covers, and limited kit procurement until buyer funds available.

# Legal / buyer assurance language (sample clauses)

The following is suggested wording for buyer assurance communications and conditional acceptance clauses. Legal to adapt for jurisdictional compliance and buyer negotiations.

Sample buyer assurance clause for pilot lots:
"Highland Coffee Cooperative confirms that Lot(s) [lot_id list] were sampled and tested in accordance with the Cooperative's chain-of-custody protocol. Accredited laboratory [lab name, accreditation] conducted quantitative testing for aflatoxins (methods specified) and moisture content. Test certificates and chain-of-custody documentation are attached. Subject to the results of said tests, the Cooperative requests buyer acceptance for shipment of the referenced lots. In the event of future non-conformance identified through independent testing, the Cooperative will engage with the buyer to agree a remediation or replacement approach as per mutually agreed terms."

Minimum acceptable lab certificate format (to be attached)
- Lab header with accreditation (ISO/IEC 17025) and contact
- Sample ID matching chain-of-custody

# Monitoring & evaluation (M&E)

Primary KPIs
- % of pilot lots reaching <12% moisture within pilot period.
- Change in mean aflatoxin (ppb) between baseline and weekly tests.
- % of pilot farmers correctly operating kits after 1 training (assessed via checklist).
- Time from sample collection to lab certificate uploaded (target median ≤72 hours).
- Number of lot-level QR records accessible and functioning.

Reporting cadence
- Daily: Moisture readings uploaded to pilot dashboard.
- Weekly: Aggregate lab results and short narrative (issues/actions) uploaded.
- End of Week 4: Full pilot synthesis report and buyer assurance packet.

Dashboard fields (minimum)
- Site status summary (best/typical/worst): active farmers, kits deployed, % lots <12% moisture.
- Graphs: per-site moisture time-series; per-site toxin time-series.
- Table: per-lot record with links to QR page and lab certificate.

# Cost estimates (indicative pilot budget, 3 sites)

Assumptions: 3 sites; ~12–20 farmers/site (40–50 farmers total). Prices indicative and subject to local supplier quotes.

Table: Indicative pilot budget (USD)

| Item | Quantity | Unit cost | Subtotal |
|------|---------:|----------:|---------:|
| Kit A (raised bed) | 10 beds | $80 | $800 |
| Kit B (covered rack components) | 3 units | $350 | $1,050 |
| Kit C (hub dryer) | 1 hub | $2,000 | $2,000 |
| Moisture meters (calibrated) | 4 | $120 | $480 |
| Sample bags & labeling | lump | $300 | $300 |
| QR labels & printer | lump | $350 | $350 |
| Training & materials | 3 sessions | $200 | $600 |
| Field staff travel & per diems | 3 weeks | $1,200 | $1,200 |
| Lab tests (baseline + weekly for 3 weeks) | 12 tests | $90 | $1,080 |
| Contingency (10–15%) | lump | — | $1,000 |
| Incentives for farmers (small inputs) | 50 farmers | $10 | $500 |
| Monitoring & data hosting | 1 month | $300 | $300 |
| Total (indicative) | | | $9,660 |

Notes
- If buyer advance or funding is secured, procurement can scale beyond pilot. Cost-per-farmer in pilot scenario ~ $190; this drops with shared hub models.
- Oscar to refine BOM and provide final local supplier quotes.

# Appendices

Appendix A — Sample 1-page buyer/regulator status note (template)
[This text to be personalized; sample content below]

Subject: Highland Coffee Cooperative — Immediate QA Response & 5-week Recovery Plan

Dear [Buyer contact name],

Following recent rejections flagged as suspected fungal contamination, Highland Coffee Cooperative has initiated an urgent QA response. We have mobilized a rapid 5-week recovery and traceability pilot to provide verifiable evidence and reduce quality risks.

What we are doing now (48–72 hours)
- Conducting prioritized sampling at three representative sites (best / typical / worst).
- Sending samples to accredited labs for moisture and mycotoxin analysis.
- Launching a minimal QR traceability pilot to link farmer → lot → lab test.
- Deploying low-capex drying interventions in pilot sites.

Expected timeline
- Week 1: Baseline diagnostics and sample results (initial screenings).
- Weeks 2–3: Pilot deployments and monitoring (daily moisture, weekly lab tests).
- Week 4: Consolidated buyer assurance packet (lab certificates, chain-of-custody, QR records).
- Week 5: Bankable scale-up plan for broader remediation.

How you can help
- Please confirm any preferred lab(s) or certificate formats.
- If buyer advance funding is available, this could accelerate procurement of drying kits and scale immediate interventions.

We will send the baseline diagnostic one-pager within 7 days and welcome a short call to align expectations.

Best regards,
Lisa Carter — Project Lead (Wild Advice Partners)
