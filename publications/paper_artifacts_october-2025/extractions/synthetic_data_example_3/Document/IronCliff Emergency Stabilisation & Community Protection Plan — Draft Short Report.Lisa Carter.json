Reports from site personnel and recent satellite/drone imagery indicate zones of erosion at the downstream toe, sediment-laden discharge into the natural drainage channel, and water accumulation behind the crest. Downstream receptors include three small villages (approx. population total 2,100), agricultural land, a primary school, and a community water intake located ~4.2 km downstream along the main drainage path.\n- Regulators and lenders have issued an urgent request: provide an engineer-verified emergency stabilisation and community protection plan acceptable to them within approximately three weeks. This plan must be defensible, show a clear evidence chain (data, tests, monitoring), and identify staged measures to protect people and critical infrastructure.\n\nKey constraints and complicating factors:\n- Limited pre-existing geotechnical data (few shallow borings, incomplete lab datasets). No recent cross-sections produced within the last 5 years.\n- Site access is remote; existing access road is partially washed out and may require temporary works (bridge/culvert bypass) to move 20\u201330 tonne equipment.\n- Heavy equipment procurement faces international FX and customs delays; local rental fleet is limited to small and medium class machines.\n- Active Indigenous land claims and culturally sensitive areas within a 1.5 km radius from the site. Community liaison and legal review are essential before any external engagement or on-site activities on Indigenous land.\n- Weather forecasts indicate intermittent heavy showers, with one 48-hour window of more intense rainfall expected within the next 7 days (monitor closely).\n\nOur role and scope:\n- Wild Advice will provide rapid triage: coordinate remote sensing and mapping, recommend priority in-field borings and monitoring installations, define concept-level temporary stabilisation options, produce an engineer-ready package for regulators/lenders, and lead initial stakeholder liaison until on-site engineers (firm(s) contracted) can verify and implement the recommended works.\n- We will not sign off on permanent engineering works \u2014 Wild Advice will coordinate emergency geotechnical consultancies who will provide engineer-signed deliverables for regulator/lender submission.\n\nImmediate objective:\n- Deliver a defensible, timeboxed 3-week plan that: (a) protects people and downstream receptors; (b) documents short-term stabilisation options capable of immediate implementation (temporary, reversible where possible); (c) identifies required data, supplier options, permits, and community consent steps necessary for engineered works and mobilization.\n\nSuccess criteria (how we will know the plan is acceptable):\n- Regulator and lenders confirm receipt of the submission package and indicate the plan is sufficient to avoid enforcement action within the immediate triage period; or provide a clear list of required clarifications.\n- Temporary measures implemented within 72 hours reduce immediate downstream release risk (as measured by discharge observation and monitoring points).\n- Community safety protocols and evacuation mapping verified by local leaders and Marcos.\n- Geotechnical borings and baseline monitoring completed within the first 7 days to enable final engineer verification in week 3.\n\n---\n\n2) Safety-first immediate actions (0\u201324 hours) \u2014 detailed tasks, checklists, and templates\n\nTop-line instruction: Safety of people first. Any deployment or engagement must follow the on-site safety plan, including work permits, PPE, traffic and access control, and specific community consent requirements. Do NOT send external comms until legal and Marcos have reviewed.\n\nFor each numbered action below we provide: objective, step-by-step tasks, deliverables, acceptance criteria, and quick templates where relevant.\n\nAction 1. Issue internal acknowledgement to regulator/lender (Owner: Lisa) \u2014 draft only\n- Objective: Acknowledge awareness of incident, confirm Wild Advice support and that an engineer-verified plan is in progress, request any data the regulator/lender may hold, and request preferred format for future submissions.

Marcos leads local community communications.\n\nStakeholder mapping (initial)\n- Regulators (primary): National Environmental Agency (NEA) \u2014 primary contact: [insert contact when available]; Regional Mines Inspectorate \u2014 backup.\n- Lenders: Senior Credit Officer (Bank/Institution) \u2014 contact to be provided by lender.\n- IronCliff operations: Site Manager \u2014 name, phone, email (request from IronCliff).\n- Community/Indigenous: Chairpersons, Elders, Health Centre Leader, School Principal.\n- Media: local outlets (to be managed only by corporate comms and legal).\n- Local emergency services: Fire, EMS, Police.\n\nApproval workflow (internal)\n1. Draft message prepared by Lisa -> posted to ops channel.\n2. Legal reviews for legal risk and Indigenous land-claim implications (timeline: 12 hours).\n3. Marcos reviews for cultural and community engagement implications (timeline: 12 hours).\n4. Wild Advice leads (Lisa and Oscar) sign off; external send only after step 3 complete.\n\nSuggested immediate regulator/lender draft language (internal draft for approval)\n- Keep to 3\u20135 brief paragraphs: acknowledgement of incident, brief description of actions Wild Advice is undertaking, expected timeline for engineer-verified plan, and request for any available data and preferred submission format. Example (internal draft):\n  - \"We acknowledge the incident at IronCliff tailings containment and confirm that Wild Advice has initiated emergency triage and coordination with geotechnical specialists. Our immediate priorities are to secure people and downstream receptors, rapidly collect and interpret data (remote sensing, borings, monitoring), and deliver an engineer-verified stabilization and community protection plan within approximately three weeks. We request any existing geotechnical and monitoring data you hold, and we would appreciate guidance on preferred submission format for engineered plans. Please note legal and Indigenous-consultation steps are being followed and external communications will be coordinated.\"\n\nRapid Q&A and escalation matrix\n- All urgent field incidents: immediate alert to ops channel -> on-call engineer and Marcos -> decide on evacuation if necessary.\n- Media enquiry: refer to legal / corporate communications \u2014 no staff to comment to media.\n- Regulator request for immediate data not in our possession: escalate to Lisa to request from IronCliff and copy regulator to avoid time delays (retain legal pre-clear).\n\nCommunity messaging (principles and templates)\n- Principles: short, clear, non-technical; focus on safety, what is known, what is being done, and what people should do (phone numbers, meeting points).\n- Template (to be used only after legal + Marcos approval):\n  - \"We are aware of conditions at the IronCliff site and are working with engineers and your community leaders to ensure your safety. At this time, please avoid the river/stream and low-lying areas downstream of the quarry. If you notice unusual discoloured water, new springs, or cracks near the ground, please report immediately to [local contact]. We will hold a community meeting at [time/place] to explain next steps and answer questions.\"\n\nRecordkeeping and confidentiality\n- All communications, data transfers, and decisions must be logged in the project folder with time stamps and owner IDs.

Temporary stabilisation options \u2014 descriptions, pros/cons, material estimates\n\n1. Toe buttress\n- Description: Add mass at the downstream toe to increase resisting forces and reduce driving forces; typically rockfill or compacted fill keyed into existing embankment.\n- Materials: Rockfill, geotextile separation, filter layer as required.\n- Pros: Immediate effect on stability; relatively simple to place.\n- Cons: Requires heavy machinery and safe access; may be disruptive to downstream environment if not contained.\n- Ballpark material estimate: For a 50 m long compromised segment requiring a 5 m wide 2 m thick buttress: Volume ~500 m3 rock (subject to engineer confirmation).\n\n2. Controlled diversion (surface water management)\n- Description: Temporary diversion channel or flap to route surface runoff away from compromised sections and reduce inflow to the basin.\n- Materials: Sandbags, temporary culverts, geotextile-lined channels, silt fences.\n- Pros: Low-cost, rapid; reduces surface inflow.\n- Cons: May be overtopped during extreme rainfall; requires good design to prevent erosion at diversion outlet.\n\n3. Staged dewatering (pumping)\n- Description: Use of submersible pumps to lower ponded water and reduce pore pressures; must be staged to avoid rapid drawdown that could destabilize slopes.\n- Materials: Pumps, fuel, pipes, manifolds, containment for discharged water (sediment traps).\n- Pros: Rapid reduction of ponded water.\n- Cons: Requires careful control; dewatering may lead to differential settlement or uncontrolled seepage unless accompanied by drainage works.\n\n4. Temporary sediment & filter barriers\n- Description: Deploy silt curtains and coffer dams to reduce downstream turbidity and limit suspended solids transport.\n- Pros: Protects downstream water users; simple to deploy in low-flow conditions.\n- Cons: Limited efficacy in high flows; needs anchoring and maintenance.\n\nB2. Geotechnical field sampling and lab tests \u2014 protocol summary\n\nMinimum sample types and lab tests required for interim stability analysis:\n- Disturbed samples: particle size distribution (sieve + hydrometer), natural moisture content, Atterberg limits, specific gravity.\n- Undisturbed samples (where possible): unit weight, consolidation test (oedometer), undrained triaxial test (UU or CU depending on sample quality).\n- Index properties reported with method references (ASTM/ISO numbers).\n- Chain-of-custody form to accompany each sample (template below).\n\nChain-of-custody sample form (brief)\n- Sample ID | Date/Time | Collector | Location (lat/long) | Depth | Sample type | Preservation | Lab sent to | Signature\n\nB3.
