    "content": "# MultiLever \u2014 Rapid Diagnostic & Action Plan for Demand Shortfall\n\nPrepared by: Lisa Carter (Wild Advice Partners)  \nDate: [Prepared on delivery]\n\n---\n\n## Executive summary\n\nMultiLever is operating in an environment of sustained elevated inflation (~10%) and has experienced a material pullback in consumer demand concentrated in three core categories: food, home appliances, and toys. Reported retail and channel sales indicate an aggregate demand decline of approximately 20% in the most recent quarter, with concentrated impacts by SKU, region and channel. This document provides a rapid, actionable pathway the client can adopt immediately: a 5-business-day rapid diagnostic to identify principal demand drivers; 2\u20133 week modelling to prioritise tactics and estimate financial impacts across price, pack-size and promotion levers; and a pragmatic operational contingency and pilot deployment approach with low-capex hybrid solutions to preserve critical service delivery and customer trust during the operational downturn.\n\nKey recommendations (high-level):\n- Execute a 5-business-day rapid diagnostic to produce SKU and category-level elasticities and an initial causal prioritisation of demand drivers (Owner: Lisa; Data: Alex).\n- Run in-parallel 2\u20133 week scenario modelling to quantify price/promotions/pack-size/margin trade-offs and recommend prioritized tactics by ROI and operational feasibility (Owner: Lisa).\n- Deliver a prioritized implementation plan and pilot deployments by the end of week 4; pilots to validate assumptions, deliver quick wins, and build lender/investor confidence (Owners: Lisa, Oscar, Marcos, Sara).\n- Where continuity of critical services is at risk (cold chain, clinics, telecom nodes), deploy rapid hybrid energy contingency solutions (rental/refurb gensets + battery buffers) that minimize lead-time and capital outlay.\n\nIntended outcomes:\n- Arrest demand decline in prioritized cohorts by implementing targeted price/pack and promotion micro-experiments.\n- Preserve margin by selecting high-ROI actions and minimizing blanket discounting.\n- Protect critical operations and customer trust via short-term, low-capex operational contingency deployments.\n- Produce lender-ready investor-risk and procurement-waiver materials to unlock staged funding and vendor flexibility.\n\n---\n\n## Background and scope\n\nProblem statement:\n- Inflation has risen to ~10% YoY across the operating geography. Wage growth and disposable income erosion have been uneven; however, observed basket behaviour indicates a material shift away from discretionary and mid-tier value goods toward essentials and lower-price alternatives.\n- MultiLever's sales telemetry shows a ~20% decline in consumer demand this past quarter concentrated in food (fresh and value-pack staples), home appliances (entry-to-mid tier), and toys (seasonality exacerbated by price sensitivity). Channel shifts toward informal markets and competitor promotions are likely contributors.\n\nClient ask:\n- Provide a rapid, practical diagnostic of the demand falloff.\n- Recommend short- and medium-term tactics to stabilise demand and margins.\n- Propose operational contingency measures for critical loads and an immediate pilot pathway for rapid deployment where continuity is essential.\n- Produce investor-facing materials to expedite procurement and pilot funding.\n\nScope:\n- Rapid diagnostic (0\u20135 business days).\n- Scenario modelling and prioritisation (2\u20133 weeks).\n- Short-term operational contingency & pilot deployment plan (0\u20134 weeks).\n- Procurement and investor considerations for staged funding, rentals/refurbishment acceptance and limited telemetry read access.\n- Deliverables include: diagnostic summary, scenario deck, pilot BOM and siting checklist, investor-risk memo, procurement waiver rationale and a prioritized implementation plan with named owners.\n\nAssumptions and boundaries:\n- This engagement focuses on short-to-medium term interventions; we do not propose full product redesigns or long-lead R&D pipelines within the first 4 weeks.\n- Data access is partial and may include sanitized billing slices, channel-level data, third-party e-commerce telemetry, and fallback proxies (satellite nightlights) where direct SCADA or full telemetry are unavailable.\n- All operational contingency solutions assume compliance with local regulations; permit risks and local restrictions will be flagged and mitigations proposed but cannot be overridden without client approvals.\n\n---\n\n## Rapid diagnostic (0\u20135 business days) \u2014 objective and deliverable\n\nObjective:\n- Identify the primary drivers of demand decline, decomposed by category and SKU: price elasticity vs. income effects (household budget reallocation) vs. channel shifts vs. competitive promotional activity vs. availability/stockouts.\n- Produce SKU/category-level elasticity estimates and an actionable prioritised list of micro-tests (price, pack-size, targeted promotion) to run immediately.\n\nPrimary deliverable:\n- A concise 1-page executive diagnostic that highlights top 10 demand drivers, top 20 SKUs by lost sales potential (absolute and %), and a data appendix with assumptions and confidence bands.\n\nOwners:\n- Lisa \u2014 rapid synthesis and lead for diagnostic write-up and stakeholder communication.\n- Alex \u2014 data ingestion, validation, and provisional elasticity model outputs.\n\nData & methods (detailed):\n- Inputs:\n  - Sales/billing slices by SKU, channel and geography (last 12 months, weekly or daily granularity if available).\n  - E-commerce telemetry (click-through rates, add-to-cart, conversion rates by SKU).\n  - Promotional calendar and competitor observed promotions (retail ad scraping where available).\n  - Inventory & stockout logs (if available).\n  - Cost inputs and margin structures at SKU level (or best-estimate cost-to-serve).\n  - External proxies: satellite nightlights (to infer demand shifts across zones), mobility indices, publicly available CPI breakdowns.\n- Models:\n  - Short-run price elasticity estimation using difference-in-differences across adjacent weeks and matched-control SKUs where an internal price change exists.\n  - Cross-elasticity checks for cannibalisation between pack sizes.\n  - Channel shift decomposition using panel regressions that include fixed effects for store/region/time.\n  - A simple Bayesian shrinkage approach to produce conservative confidence bands when data is thin.\n- Fallback plan:\n  - If SCADA or detailed telemetry is blocked, use conservative envelopes: assume lower-bound elasticity estimates and higher uncertainty; produce a \"safe action\" list that is robust to worst-case elasticity realizations.\n\nExpected outputs:\n- 1-page diagnostic (narrative + 1 composite chart showing SKU-level demand change and elasticities).\n- Data appendix with:\n  - Assumptions log.\n  - Confidence band methodology.\n  - Raw data descriptors and missing-data notes.\n- A prioritized micro-test list (3\u20136 high-probability, low-cost interventions) ready for immediate execution.\n\nRapid diagnostic templates (to be populated):\n- SKU priority table (example):\n\n| Rank | SKU | Category | QoQ Demand \u0394 (%) | Estimated Price Elasticity | Confidence (High/Med/Low) | Immediate Action |\n|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---|---|\n| 1 | SKU-12345 | Food \u2013 Staple rice 2kg | -28% | -1.6 | Med | Trial smaller 1kg value-pack at -5% price |\n| 2 | SKU-23456 | Home appliance \u2013 Toaster | -32% | -2.1 | Low | Targeted promotion to loyalty cohort |\n| ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |\n\nMilestones & timing (0\u20135 business days):\n- Day 0: Kickoff, data requests issued (Lisa/Alex).\n- Day 1\u20132: Data ingestion, initial cleaning and exploratory analysis (Alex).\n- Day 2\u20134: Rapid modelling and synthesis (Lisa & Alex).\n- Day 5: Delivery of 1-page diagnostic + data appendix and short briefing call with client.\n\nConfidence & caveats:\n- Where telemetry is limited, we will flag conservative bounds and recommend micro-tests that are robust in direction under the plausible elasticity range.\n- All outputs should be interpreted as provisional and used to prioritise real-world micro-experiments; definitive decisions should await validation via pilots.\n\n---\n\n## Modelling & scenarios (2\u20133 weeks)\n\nObjective:\n- Build a suite of analytic models that quantify demand and margin impacts across tactical levers: price adjustment, pack-size, targeted promotions, and cost-to-serve improvements.\n- Provide prioritization by expected ROI, implementation speed and operational feasibility.\n\nDeliverables:\n- Scenario deck (10\u201325 slides/pages) showing uplift/downside under multiple tactics, ROI sensitivity tables and a recommended prioritisation list.\n- Detailed model appendix including elasticities, channel covariance matrices and cost assumptions.\n\nOwners:\n- Lisa \u2014 modelling lead, recommendations author.\n- Alex \u2014 data integration, model validation and sensitivity analysis.\n- Sara \u2014 procurement inputs and vendor cost validation for operational interventions.\n\nModel approach (granular):\n- Elasticity models:\n  - Short-run own-price elasticity per SKU using time-series models and where possible quasi-experimental identification (price changes, promotions, geo-based differences).\n  - Cross-price elasticities estimated for related SKUs (substitutes/complements).\n- Promotion response model:\n  - Lift estimation for promotions by channel and cohort (loyalty vs. new customers).\n  - Promotion ROI calculated as incremental gross margin / incremental promotional cost.\n- Pack-size optimisation:\n  - Evaluate margin per unit of consumption and consumer purchase frequency response.\n  - Simulate introductions of value packs (smaller pack at lower absolute price) to capture budget-constrained households.\n- Cost-to-serve scenarios:\n  - Logistics routing and channel-mix optimisation: estimate margin impact from shifting a % of sales from home-delivery to retail, or to hub-and-pick.\n  - Packaging & product-cost tradeoffs: smaller pack sizes often increase per-unit FOB cost but may unlock volume.\n\nKey scenarios to model (examples):\n1. Price reduction across top 20 elastic SKUs by -5% and -10% with promotion targeting top 25% of customers by past purchase frequency.\n2. Introduce 1kg value-pack for top 10 staple SKUs (repackaging cost known) and forecast incremental volume and margin changes.\n3. Shift 20% of fulfilment from high-cost last-mile to consolidated pick-up hubs and estimate cost-to-serve savings.\n4. Temporary targeted couponing for the top 10% high-ROI cohorts (loyalty members) vs. blanket 10% off site-wide promotions.\n5. Rapid product-tiering: introduce a lower-cost formulation/value-tier at a 20\u201330% lower price with assumed cannibalisation rates.\n\nScenario output template (partial example):\n\n| Scenario ID | Action | Implementation Lead | Time to Deploy | Estimated Volume \u0394 (qtr) | Estimated Margin Impact (qtr) | IRR / ROI | Key Risks |\n|---:|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|\n| S1 | -5% price on 20 elastic SKUs + targeted coupon | Lisa/Sales Ops | 1\u20132 weeks | +6% | -1.2% absolute margin | High (low friction) | Competitor match |\n| S2 | 1kg value-pack for staples | Ops/Procure | 3\u20135 weeks | +11% | +0.8% | High (packaging cost acceptable) | Supply chain delays |\n| S3 | Hub-and-pick logistics shift 20% | Logistics | 4\u20136 weeks | +3% | +1.5% | Med | Customer convenience reduction |\n\nSensitivity & confidence:\n- Each scenario will include a sensitivity table across three elasticity bands (optimistic/central/pessimistic) and three competitor-response assumptions (no match / partial match / full match).\n\nOperationalisation of micro-tests:\n- For the highest-priority micro-tests, develop an A/B testing plan with control stores/channels, duration (2\u20134 weeks), and measurement KPIs (incremental units, retention, margin per customer, redemption rate).\n\nBudgeting & financial modelling:\n- Include cost inputs from procurement (Sara) for packaging changes, promotional costs (media/discount), and operational changes (hub setup costs).\n- Produce simple P&L impact per scenario for the first 3 months and a 12-month run-rate projection under a roll-out assumption.\n\n---\n\n## Short-term operational contingency & pilot deployment (0\u20134 weeks)\n\nRationale:\n- For critical operations (cold-chain for perishables, health clinic refrigeration, telecom nodes, water pumps), the priority is to maintain service continuity and customer trust. Procurement lead-times and FX constraints make new CAPEX unattractive; rentals/refurb approach reduces time-to-implement and preserves capital and lender flexibility.\n\nPrototype summary (rapid hybrid energy solution):\n- Core concept: a locally rented/purchased diesel genset (50\u201380 kVA) paired with a modest battery buffer (20\u2013100 kWh, refurbished where feasible) with Automatic Transfer Switch (ATS) and basic protection. The hybrid approach reduces fuel usage compared to pure genset and provides transient ride-through and clean switching.\n- Key components (prototype BOM overview):\n  - Diesel genset: 50\u201380 kVA, IP-rated enclosure, noise attenuated where required.\n  - Battery buffer: 20\u2013100 kWh (refurb Li-ion modules or lead-acid depending on vendor availability), inverter/charger sized to match genset output.\n  - ATS & basic distribution, protection & metering.\n  - Modular skid, minimal civil works, basic fire and spill containment.\n- Ballpark scoping (deployment-only, site placeholder until final BOM):\n  - Purchase CAPEX per site: $26k\u201375k (variance for genset size, battery capacity, shipping and installation).\n  - Rental/refurb initial outlay per site: $10k\u201325k (first-month rental + transportation + installation/commissioning).\n  - OPEX: fuel, rental fees, battery replacement provisioning, maintenance. Fuel expected to be the dominant OPEX for pure genset-only options.\n\nPrototype cost table (example ranges):\n\n| Item | Unit cost (purchase) | Rental (per month) | Notes |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| 60 kVA diesel genset (incl. shipping & install) | $22,000 | $1,500\u20132,500 | Noise and fuel consumption spec to be confirmed |\n| Battery buffer 40 kWh (refurb) | $8,000 | $800\u20131,200 | Cycle life and warranties limited |\n| ATS & protection | $1,500 | n/a | ATS rated for site configuration |\n| Installation & commissioning | $3,000 | $750 | Local labour rates apply |\n| Containment & siting works | $1,500 | $300 | Depending on site |\n| Total (typical mid-range purchase) | $36,000 | $3,500\u20135,000 | Excludes permits and fuel |\n\nCritical loads to protect (examples and sizing guidance):\n- Health clinic refrigeration: Typical continuous load 1\u20133 kW; high surge on compressor start; battery buffer 10\u201320 kWh recommended for ride-through; genset sized 30\u201345 kVA to handle simultaneous clinic loads and ancillary lighting.\n- Vaccine cold-chain: Highly sensitive; require redundant cooling; propose refrigerated container with separate monitoring and dual power sources.\n- Water pumps: Pumps for distribution can be high starting current; require genset sizing to accommodate motor inrush.\n- Telecom nodes: Low continuous power, high availability required; batteries provide ride-through, genset for extended outages.\n- Targeted household circuits (vulnerable users): consider small rental inverter/genset combos and prioritize community hubs.\n\nPilot approach and timeline:\n- Site selection (24 hours): Marcos to propose two pilot sites. Selection criteria include existing genset or clear rental option, permission to host, presence of critical loads, security, and local vendor access.\n- Prototype spec & BOM (12 hours): Oscar to deliver detailed BOM, siting checklist, and basic electrical layouts.\n- Energy envelopes (48 hours): Alex to provide hourly/daily energy demand envelopes and priority loads per candidate site.\n- Vendor matrix (48 hours): Sara to provide rental/refurb vendor list with lead-times, payment terms, logistics feasibility and permit sensitivity.\n- Deployment window: Rapid pilot to be installed within 7\u201314 days of site confirmation (dependent on vendor lead-times).\n- Monitoring: Remote metering where possible (basic CT-based kWh and runtime) and daily operational logs for the first 2 weeks.\n\nPilot task list (detailed):\n- Pre-deployment:\n  - Confirm site host agreement and permits (Marcos).\n  - Confirm exact load list and criticality ranking (Alex).\n  - Vendor contracting and delivery windows (Sara).\n  - Logistics & security plan (Oscar/Marcos).\n- Deployment:\n  - Site preparation (concrete pad if required, spill containment).\n  - Install genset, battery and ATS, wiring to critical circuits.\n  - Commissioning including load testing, fuel and charging cycles.\n  - Remote telemetry setup (if allowed) for runtime and energy data.\n- Post-deployment:\n  - 14-day operational monitoring, daily check-ins, weekly report.\n  - Micro-experiment measuring customer/household service continuity and any demand response (do customers return? are purchases maintained?).\n  - Decision gate: scale, modify or exit.\n\nPilot acceptance criteria:\n- System meets load requirements under design scenarios for 24 hours continuous operation with refuelling/rental schedules defined.\n- Operational metrics: <2 unplanned outages in first 14 days; fuel consumption within predicted envelope \u00b115%.\n- Customer metrics: no increase in customer complaints for service availability post-deployment vs baseline.\n- Financial: rental & fuel costs within budget envelope; minimal capex committed prior to lender sign-off.\n\nEnvironmental, regulatory and safety considerations:\n- Fuel storage and noise regulations frequently bind. Include local authority permit checks early.\n- Fire and spill containment must meet local environmental rules.\n- Batteries (refurb) require careful testing, containment and handling procedures; vendor warranties should be documented.\n\n---\n\n## Procurement & investor considerations\n\nObjective:\n- Enable rapid pilots and lender support by providing clear, lender-ready materials that justify rentals/refurbs, staged deliverables, and limited read-only telemetry access where privacy-compliant.\n\nKey documents to produce:\n1. 1-page executive summary for lenders (fast read).\n2. 2\u20133 page investor-risk memo that articulates data limitations, procurement strategies, milestone-based funding release, and downside mitigation.\n3. Procurement-waiver rationale to permit rentals/refurb procurement, staged deliverables and limited telemetry access.\n\nInvestor-risk memo structure (recommended contents):\n- Context & immediate need: succinct rationale for pilot deployments and the link to demand stabilisation.\n- Data limitations: explicit detail on missing telemetry, impact on certainty and proposed conservative assumptions.\n- Procurement & contracting approach: rationale for rentals/refurbs, vendor selection criteria, payment-terms and FX exposure mitigation.\n- Staged funding & milestone triggers:\n  - Stage A: Upfront funds for rentals/refurbs upon site confirmation and vendor commitment (e.g., 30% hold).\n  - Stage B: Release for installation as acceptance tests pass (e.g., commissioning certificate).\n  - Stage C: Scale-up funding contingent on pilot KPI thresholds being met for 14\u201328 days.\n- Risk-sharing with lenders: propose capped exposure, lender collateral where feasible, and clear exit clauses.\n- Compliance & approvals: clarity on permits and environmental checks required; request limited read-only telemetry access to de-risk operations.\n- Appendices: sample BOM, vendor list, cost-breakdown and pilot KPIs.\n\nProcurement-waiver rationale (points to include):\n- Time-critical nature of deployment and limited lead-times for new CAPEX.\n- Rentals/refurb mitigate capital and FX constraints while delivering continuity.\n- Staged payments reduce lender exposure; vendor performance guarantees or deposit structures recommended.\n- Read-only telemetry limited to operational metrics (kWh, runtime) with anonymized customer data and privacy protections.\n\nSuggested lender materials deliverables and timeline:\n- Lisa to upload drafts to BlueHarbor/Technical/Investor_Memo/ within 12 hours.\n- One-page executive summary completed same day as diagnostic to allow lender briefing pre-pilot.\n\nVendor contracting & payment considerations:\n- Prefer local vendors where possible to reduce shipping and customs delays.\n- Evaluate deposit vs. progress payment structures; where FX volatility is high, consider indexed payment clauses.\n- Where warranty on refurbished batteries is limited, negotiate remuneration or replacement clauses.\n\n---\n\n## Data & inputs required (priority & deadlines)\n\nTo execute the rapid diagnostic and pilot correctly, the following inputs are required with recommended formats and deadlines.\n\nPriority inputs (owner & deadline):\n- Provisional demand models (billing-slices + satellite night-lights fallback) and conservative hourly/daily envelopes per candidate site \u2014 Owner: Alex (48 hours).

Request expedited lender feedback.\n\nCommunication:\n- Schedule a 30-minute briefing call 24 hours after deliverables begin arriving to agree on Site A selection and immediate vendor holds.\n\n---\n\n## KPIs and monitoring framework (pilot & rollout)\n\nPrimary KPIs for diagnostics and pilots:\n- Customer demand indicators:\n  - Incremental units sold (pilot catchment) vs. control (% change).\n  - Redemption and repeat purchase rate for targeted promotions.\n  - Basket size and change in channel mix (pick-up vs delivery).\n- Financial KPIs:\n  - Incremental gross margin (per SKU and aggregated) attributable to intervention.\n  - Promotion ROI = Incremental gross contribution / promotional cost.\n  - OPEX pilot: fuel cost per day, rental cost, labour.\n- Operational KPIs:\n  - Uptime (%) for protected critical loads.\n  - Fuel consumption vs predicted (litres/day).\n  - Number of unplanned outages.\n- Lender/investor KPIs (for funding gates):\n  - Pilot acceptance by site host.\n  - Achievement of defined customer and operational KPIs for 14 days.\n\nReporting cadence:\n- Daily operational logs for first 14 days of pilot.\n- Weekly KPI snapshot for stakeholders.\n- End-of-pilot 2\u20133 page summary with recommendation to scale, modify or exit.\n\nMonitoring tools:\n- Basic meter telemetry (CT-based kWh counter) feeding into a simple dashboard (Excel/Google Sheets).\n- Daily photo logs and runtime logs (SMS/WhatsApp as low-bandwidth fallback).\n- Weekly telecon to review lessons and course-correct.\n\n---\n\n## Vendor selection & evaluation template\n\nVendor evaluation criteria (weighting suggestion included):\n- Lead time (25%)\n- Price / Total Cost (20%)\n- Reliability & warranty (20%)\n- Local logistics capability / spare parts (15%)\n- Safety & IEC/standards compliance (10%)\n- Permitting & regulatory experience (10%)\n\nVendor evaluation example table:\n\n| Vendor | Lead time (days) | Rental $/mo | Warranty | Local presence | Notes | Score |\n|---|---:|---:|---|---|---|---:|\n| Vendor A | 3 | 2,000 | 6 months (genset) | Strong | Good local support | 88 |\n| Vendor B | 12 | 1,200 | 3 months (refurb batt) | Medium | Needs import | 65 |\n\nContract clauses recommended:\n- Performance testing acceptance prior to 2nd payment.\n- Short-term replacement clause for battery failure in first 90 days.\n- Option for conversion to purchase at pre-agreed price after pilot success.\n\nPayment terms:\n- Prefer monthly rental invoices in local currency where FX is volatile.\n- If import unavoidable, specify indexed payments or partial escrow.\n\n---\n\n## Sample permit & site checklist (for pilots)\n\nSite selection & permit checklist:\n- Site name and address, host contact & backup.\n- Security: fenced site, night security, insurance coverage.\n- Ground & siting: flat concrete pad recommended; drainage and spill containment checked.\n- Fuel storage: allowed on site? Max litres permitted and secondary containment.\n- Noise constraints: local quiet hours and noise limits.\n- Electrical connection points: nearest distribution panel and load mapping.\n- Fire safety: nearby hydrants, fire extinguishers, signage.\n- Environmental permits: check local municipality requirements for temporary genset and battery deployment.\n\nOperational checklist (pre-commissioning):\n- Verify generator sizing vs load sheet (including starting currents).\n- Battery state-of-health test and vendor certification.\n- ATS wiring & fail-safe testing.\n- Fuel arrangement: supplier, delivery windows, storage documentation.\n- Emergency contacts and escalation numbers.\n\n---\n\n## Risks revisited with contingency playbooks\n\nTop 3 near-term contingencies:\n\n1. Vendor lead-time spike:\n   - Contingency: switch to rental vendors with shorter lead-times even if marginally more expensive; start partial deployments focusing on highest risk circuits.\n2.
