pre-clear offers with finance/legal team.\n  - Consider alternative offers (gift cards, rebates) if financing unworkable.\n\n5) Operational execution failures (inventory stockouts during pilot)\n- Probability: Medium | Impact: High\n- Mitigation:\n  - Coordinate forecasting with supply chain; secure buffer inventory for pilot SKUs.\n  - Daily inventory checks and quick restock protocols.\n\n6) Unintended cannibalization across SKUs\n- Probability: Medium | Impact: Medium\n- Mitigation:\n  - Measure cross-price elasticities and include cannibalization in pilot analysis.\n  - Pre-specify acceptable cannibalization thresholds; include substitution adjustments in ROI calculations.\n\nRisk register example (prioritized)\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation action | Owner |\n|---|---:|---:|---|---|\n| SKU data missing critical fields | High | High | Request sample extracts; use aggregated proxies; escalate to sponsor | Alex / Lisa |\n| Supplier cannot support new pack size | Medium | Medium-High | Use alternative packaging or third-party co-packer; adjust pilot to promotion instead | Oscar |\n| Financing offer blocked by compliance | Low | High | Pre-clear with legal; prepare alternative offers | Lisa / Legal |\n\n---\n\n# Privacy & compliance\n\nMinimum standards\n- All handling of consumer-level data must comply with applicable data protection laws (GDPR, local privacy regulations) and client internal policies.\n- Use hashed/pseudonymized customer identifiers when consumer-level data is required for analysis. Keep mapping keys separate and under client control.\n- Limit access to raw files to named project members; use role-based access control for storage.\n- Use secure transfer protocols (SFTP, signed AWS S3 presigned URLs) and encryption-at-rest.\n\nRetention & disposal\n- Agree on retention period for project extracts; typical policy: retain for the duration of the engagement + 90 days unless otherwise specified.\n- After the retention period, purge raw files and document deletion steps with receipts.\n\nData sharing & third parties\n- Any engagement of contractors (economist, external co-packer) requires a data processing agreement (DPA) and NDA.\n- Provide only the minimum necessary data to third parties; prefer aggregated data where possible.\n\nAudit & documentation\n- Maintain an access log for data extracts and transformations.\n- Provide documentation of pseudonymization steps, encryption keys handling and data deletion.\n\n---\n\n# Next steps (first 72 hours)\n\n1) Finalize and send the data request\n   - Action: Lisa/Alex to send the prioritized file list (as detailed above) to data owners; include target formats (parquet/CSV), sample extract request (4\u20136 weeks) and contact details.\n   - Target: within 24 hours (Day 0).\n2) Lock a 60-minute kickoff within 48\u201372 hours\n   - Proposed slot: tomorrow 19:00 CET (please confirm with Marcos and client sponsor).\n   - Kickoff agenda (60 minutes):\n     - 0\u20135 min: introductions and objectives\n     - 5\u201320 min: client context and constraints (finance, R&D, fulfillment)\n     - 20\u201335 min: data availability & handover plan\n     - 35\u201345 min: pilot feasibility constraints and quick wins\n     - 45\u201360 min: next steps, milestone confirmations and Q&A\n3) Begin data ingestion and request sample extracts\n   - Alex to set up ingestion pipelines for sample files; run initial data quality checks within 24\u201348 hours of receipt.\n4) Deliver Day-5 diagnostic and propose 2\u20133 pilot concepts for rapid approval\n   - Lisa to draft diagnostic; Oscar to validate pilot feasibility; Alex to include data appendix.\n\nChecklist for first 72 hours (owner + due date)\n- [ ] Send formal data request with sample extract instructions (Owner: Alex; Due: Day 0 + 8 hours)\n- [ ] Schedule kickoff meeting and confirm attendees (Owner: Marcos; Due: Day 0 + 12 hours)\n- [ ] Confirm legal/compliance guardrails for data sharing (Owner: Sara; Due: Day 0 + 24 hours)\n- [ ] Ingest first sample files and run data health checks (Owner: Alex; Due: Day 1)\n- [ ] Draft Day-5 diagnostic outline (Owner: Lisa; Due: Day 2)\n\nSample kickoff email (template)\nSubject: MultiLever Demand Recovery \u2014 Kickoff & Data Request (Tomorrow 19:00 CET)\nBody:\n- Brief intro, objectives, requested attendees, attach dataset schema and sample request, ask for confirmation of slot, include link to SFTP bucket or upload instructions.\n\n---\n\n# Appendix A \u2014 Pilot measurement plan (expanded)\n\nPrimary and secondary metrics (definitions)\n- Primary:\n  - Incremental volume lift vs control: (Units_treatment \u2212 Units_control) adjusted for pre-trend (difference-in-differences).\n  - Incremental gross margin: (Gross margin_treatment \u2212 Gross margin_control) after accounting for promo/trade spend and product BOM.\n  - ROI: Incremental gross margin divided by incremental promo or operational cost (including trade funds).\n- Secondary:\n  - Retention: percent of customers who repurchase within N weeks.\n  - Repeat purchase rate: repeat purchase counts per customer over a defined horizon.\n  - Price elasticity estimates: local elasticity computed from pilot outcomes to update model priors.\n  - Channel-specific lift: change in channel share (in-store vs online).\n\nStatistical analysis plan (SAP) \u2014 key points\n- Predefine the analysis window: pre-period (4 weeks baseline), treatment window (pilot duration), post-period (4 weeks if applicable).\n- Primary estimator: difference-in-differences with covariate adjustment for store/geography fixed effects and time trends.\n- Model specification example:\n  - Outcome_it = \u03b1 + \u03b2*TreatmentGroup_i*Post_t + \u03b3_i + \u03b4_t + \u03b5_it\n    - \u03b2 is the causal treatment effect estimate.\n- Adjust standard errors for clustering at the unit of randomization (store or geo).\n- Multiple testing correction: if running multiple pilots or many SKUs, use Benjamini-Hochberg FDR or Bonferroni as appropriate for hypothesis control.\n\nPower calculations (illustrative)\n- Food pilot example:\n  - Baseline per-store weekly units = 100, SD = 20\n  - Expected uplift = 8 units/week \u2192 Cohen's d = 8/20 = 0.4\n  - For \u03b1=0.05, power=0.8 \u2192 required n \u2248 50 stores total; but with weekly repeated measures and fixed effects, effective n reduces; estimate 20 stores per arm likely sufficient (see sample calc).\n- Provide exact power calcs when actual baseline means and variances are received.\n\nData engineering & measurement notes\n- Ensure promo flags are normalized across data tables and aligned to the promo calendar.\n- Synchronize timestamps across pos/online/inventory systems; convert to a standard timezone and week definition.\n- Build a \u201cpilot table\u201d that maps store_id/geo_id to treatment/control and contains planned start/end dates to feed dashboards and analyses.\n- Track inventory separately to ensure observed changes are demand-driven and not supply-constrained.\n\nSample analysis SQL (difference-in-difference)\n```\nWITH sales_week AS (\n  SELECT store_id, week_start, SUM(units_sold) AS units\n  FROM weekly_sales\n  WHERE sku_id IN ('SKU_A','SKU_B') AND week_start BETWEEN '2025-06-01' AND '2025-08-31'\n  GROUP BY store_id, week_start\n),\ntreatment_map AS (\n  SELECT store_id, treatment_flag\n  FROM pilot_store_map\n)\nSELECT s.store_id, s.week_start,\n       s.units,\n       t.treatment_flag,\n       CASE WHEN s.week_start >= '2025-07-01' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS post,\n       AVG(s.units) OVER (PARTITION BY s.store_id ORDER BY s.week_start ROWS BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS rolling_mean_units\nFROM sales_week s\nLEFT JOIN treatment_map t ON s.store_id = t.store_id;\n```",
