    "content": "# GreenRiver Rapid-Response \u2014 48h Needs Assessment & Pilot Plan (Draft)\n\nVersion: 0.1 (Draft)  \nPrepared by: Lisa Carter (Lead/PM)  \nDate: [Insert date/time]\n\n---\n\n## Executive summary\n\nGreenRiver requests urgent operational support to restore safe vaccination delivery capacity in priority localities experiencing cold-chain and service delivery constraints. This document is a working 48-hour needs-assessment and pilot plan intended to:\n\n- Define the minimum data, files, and named contacts required immediately from the client to proceed (see \"Immediate data & named contacts requested\").\n- Assign team owners and explicit deliverables with timelines and milestones (see \"Team owners & roles\" and \"Deliverables & timeline\").\n- Propose a practical pilot design for rapid mobile/modular clinic deployment including cold-chain options, shelter concepts, staffing models, and procurement priorities (see \"Pilot design (recommended baseline)\" and annexed equipment BOMs).\n- Provide a clear site selection and scoring framework, operational checklists, monitoring & evaluation metrics (including calculation definitions), and a risk register with mitigations.\n\nThis draft is actionable: once the requested data and a named RHA operations contact are provided, the team will finalize the 48-hour memo, produce a prioritized shortlist of three candidate pilot sites, complete GIS overlays, and be prepared to run pilots within the timelines below. The objective is to return safe, verifiable vaccination capability to communities quickly while minimizing cost and assembly time.\n\nKey immediate ask: supply the ten files/contacts listed in the \"Immediate data & named contacts requested\" section. With those inputs we can finalize the 48h outputs and mobilize procurement and field teams.\n\n---\n\n## Background & objective\n\nContext\n- Recent briefings and initial field reports indicate urgent cold-chain failures and constrained service-delivery capacity across several local health catchments. Challenges reported include intermittent electricity at storage nodes, broken or absent cold-chain equipment, lack of validated vaccine carriers for outreach, insufficient staffing for surge delivery, and local access/security limitations.\n- The aim is a rapid technical/operational diagnostic to identify candidate pilot sites and deploy scalable pilot interventions (mobile or modular clinics) to re-establish safe vaccine delivery at scale while minimizing cost and time.\n\nPrimary objective (48 hours)\n- Produce a rapid needs-assessment memo summarizing data-driven site prioritization, a shortlist of three candidate pilot sites with constraints and immediate actions, a community engagement script for safe rollout, and a minimal specification (BOM) for mobile/modular clinic piloting (cold-chain, shelter, staffing, essential consumables).\n\nScope (within 48 hours)\n- Data ingestion & validation from client-provided datasets.\n- Rapid GIS overlay and site-constraints analysis.\n- Shortlisting of three candidate pilot sites with preliminary feasibility scores.\n- Draft technical note on cold-chain and shelter options (Oscar \u2014 24h).\n- Draft clinical SOP and outreach checklist (Marcos \u2014 48h).\n- Community engagement script and basic IEC (information, education, communication) materials for immediate use.\n- A prioritized procurement/fill list for immediate sourcing (passive cold boxes, vaccine carriers with temp loggers, PCM packs, small solar fridges if required).\n\nOut of scope (initial 48h)\n- Full procurement and delivery of larger fixed cold-chain equipment beyond immediate passive and small solar options.\n- Full community mobilization beyond scripts and CHW briefing materials \u2014 this will begin once pilot sites are finalized.\n- Extensive training beyond a concise, field-focused orientation for pilot staff (training package to be developed if pilots proceed to week 2).\n\n---\n\n## Immediate data & named contacts requested from GreenRiver (required now)\n\nProviding these files is essential to run the 48-hour diagnostic and prioritize pilot sites by cold-chain verifiability and operational feasibility.

Please confirm client availability and named RHA operations contact to lock the slot.\n\n---\n\n## Pilot design (recommended baseline)\n\nDesign principles\n- Speed: solutions prioritized by lead time and easy assembly.\n- Verifiability: cold-chain must be demonstrably within 2\u20138\u00b0C via temp-logger records.\n- Scalability: choices should be replicable at low cost and with short procurement lead times.\n- Safety: clinical and biosafety controls must meet minimum immunization standards including AEFI readiness.\n\nSite selection guardrails (detailed)\n- Must have verifiable cold-chain: recent temp logger data within last 30 days OR capacity to install validated temp-logger and record 24\u201348h verification before vaccine delivery.\n- Access: drive/walk time within 2 hours of a hub capable of restocking or support; road passability documented.\n- Local partner presence: CHW or NGO contact able to support mobilization and provide crowd-control/community messaging.\n- Security: acceptable safety profile (no active conflict), or security mitigations in place.\n- Minimum catchment: site should serve a catchment where pilot is meaningful (e.g., >1,000 target-age population or high unmet need as per case data).\n\nCold-chain baseline (technical)\n- Short-lead solutions:\n  - Passive cold boxes (WHO PQS-recommended) for fixed-site buffer and outreach storage.\n  - Validated vaccine carriers with temperature loggers (continuous recording loggers; ideally single-use or ruggedized with multiple-day battery life).\n  - PCM (Phase Change Material) packs for outreach to maintain carriers at target temperature for extended outreach windows.\n  - Small solar-powered refrigerator (50\u2013100 L) for fixed pilot sites where mains power is unreliable (for storage of multi-dose vials).\n- Temperature monitoring protocol (quick):\n  - Deploy at least one temperature logger per vaccine storage point; set sampling interval to 5\u201315 minutes.\n  - Define in-range as 2\u20138\u00b0C; compute % time-in-range for each 24h period.\n  - For outreach sessions, loggers should accompany vaccine carriers and be downloaded at end of day.\n  - If out-of-range events occur, stop use of affected vials pending clinical guidance from Marcos.\n\nShelter & layout\n- Options:\n  - Lightweight insulated tents (rapid deploy; 3x3m or 6x3m) with raised flooring and hard surfaces for cold boxes.\n  - Quick-container conversion (shipping container modified with insulation and battery-powered fridge) where turnover time allows.\n  - Vehicle-based outreach (van with built-in cold boxes) if roads permit.\n- Assembly:\n  - Modular assembly target: 2\u20134 hours with 3 trained assemblers.\n  - Minimal footprint guidance: 6\u201312m2 per pilot point (vaccination, registration, observation).\n- Layout recommendations:\n  - Entrances/exits separated to manage flow, registration station before vaccination station, separate observation area (3\u20135 minutes observation) with seating and emergency kit nearby.\n\nMinimal staffing mix per pilot shift (example)\n- Shift length: 6\u20138 hours (adjust as needed).\n  - 2 vaccinators (trained and certified per schedule) \u2014 administer vaccines, manage AEFI immediate care.\n  - 1 registrar/recorder \u2014 records doses, logs batch numbers, maintains cold-chain documentation.\n  - 1 CHW/outreach mobilizer \u2014 community engagement, queuing control, pre-screening for eligibility.\n  - 1 logistics/driver \u2014 responsible for transport of vaccines, equipment, waste management, and cold-chain maintenance.\n- Supervisory oversight: remote clinical lead (Marcos) with on-call availability; local supervisor if multiple sites are operated.\n- Rotations and capacity:\n  - Throughput estimates: assuming 2 vaccinators, expected throughput 40\u2013100 doses per day depending on including outreach and demand; refine once local demand estimates provided.\n\nPPE & consumables checklist (pilot-level)\n- Vaccine carriers (validated) \u2014 quantity = number of outreach teams + 1 spare.\n- Passive cold boxes \u2014 1\u20132 per fixed site depending on throughput.\n- Temp-loggers (minimum 2 per site: one in storage and one in carrier).\n- PCM packs \u2014 number depends on outreach window; calculate from BOM.\n- Syringes & safety boxes/sharps containers.\n- PPE for staff (masks, gloves, hand sanitizer, aprons).\n- Waste disposal bags and supply for safe disposal.\n- Basic emergency kit: adrenaline ampoules (as per AEFI protocol), epipen if locally approved, clinical gloves, blood pressure cuff, stethoscope, and first aid.\n- Documentation: vaccine batch records, consent forms, tally sheets, IEC materials.\n\nCold-chain equipment options and lead times (summary table)\n\n| Item | Typical capacity | Use-case | Typical lead-time (procurement) | Priority |\n|---|---:|---|---:|---|\n|WHO PQS passive cold box (e.g., 16\u201340L) | 16\u201340 L | Outreach & short-term storage | Off-the-shelf local supply (0\u20137 days) | High |\n|Vaccine carrier with temp-logger | 5\u201310 L | Outreach | 3\u201314 days (loggers may require import) | High |\n|PCM packs (pre-conditioned) | N/A | Keeps carriers stable | 7\u201314 days | High |\n|Small solar fridge (50\u2013100 L) | 50\u2013100 L | Fixed pilot sites | 7\u201321 days (depending on local stock) | Medium |\n|Portable generator (small) | 1\u20132 kW | Backup power for fridge | 3\u20137 days | Medium |\n|Insulated tent (3x3, 6x3) | N/A | Shelter | 1\u20137 days local supplier | High |\n\nNote: Prioritize passive solutions and vaccine carriers with validated temp-loggers for speed. Solar fridges are higher effectiveness but longer lead times.\n\nConsumables BOM (sample short-list with unit costs estimate - provisional, to be refined with procurement team)\n| Item | Unit | Est. unit cost (USD)* | Qty (pilot x1) | Est. total |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n|Validated vaccine carrier w/ temp-logger | each | 150\u2013350 | 3 | 450\u20131,050 |\n|Passive cold box 16\u201340L | each | 80\u2013200 | 2 | 160\u2013400 |\n|PCM pack | each | 10\u201325 | 10 | 100\u2013250 |\n|Small solar fridge 50L | each | 1,200\u20132,500 | 1 | 1,200\u20132,500 |\n|Temp-logger spare units | each | 80\u2013200 | 2 | 160\u2013400 |\n|Insulated tent (6x3) | each | 300\u2013900 | 1 | 300\u2013900 |\n|Sharps disposal box (5L) | each | 8\u201315 | 2 | 16\u201330 |\n|Syringes (0.5 ml) | box 100 | 5\u201310 | 2 | 10\u201320 |\n|PPE kit (per staff/day) | kit | 8\u201315 | 5 | 40\u201375 |\n\n*Costs indicative and vary by supplier and locality; final procurement requires local quotation.\n\nThroughput modeling (simple example)\n- If 2 vaccinators deliver 10 minutes per vaccination including registration and observation is rotated to separate space, then per vaccinator assuming 6 productive hours = 36 vaccinations per vaccinator = 72 per day. Adjust for travel, outreach downtime, and breaks; realistic range 40\u201370 per day.\n\nCold-chain monitoring & temperature incident protocol (detailed)\n- Requirement: continuous temp logging at storage point and carrier during outreach.\n- Logger settings: sample interval 5\u201315 minutes; alarms set at <2\u00b0C and >8\u00b0C.\n- Daily process:\n  1. At start of day, confirm temp loggers are functioning and within 2\u20138\u00b0C.\n  2. Pre-condition PCM and carriers as per manufacturer instructions.\n  3. Record vaccine batch, dose counts, and times removed from cold-chain for each carrier.\n  4. End-of-day: download and attach temp logs to site record; calculate % time-in-range.\n- Out-of-range handling:\n  - If temp breach occurs, isolate affected vials, consult Marcos for risk assessment and safe disposal or use decision.\n  - If breach >2 hours or sustained above 8\u00b0C, treat vials as compromised unless manufacturer guidance indicates tolerance (document decision).\n\nWaste management\n- Sharps containers should be present and not overfilled.\n- Segregation of medical waste and safe disposal arrangement with local authorities or contracted waste handlers.\n- Burning pits or incineration only if permitted and done per local environmental guidance.\n\n---\n\n## Site selection & scoring framework\n\nProposed scoring criteria (0\u20135 scale per criterion; higher = more favorable). Weighting shown as percent; adjust as needed.\n\n| Criterion | Weight | Scoring notes |\n|---|---:|---|\n|Cold-chain verifiability (recent temp logs) | 25% | 5 = logs within 30 days and in-range; 0 = no logs |\n|Access & travel time to hub (road access) | 20% | 5 = <30 min; 1 = 90\u2013120 min |\n|Local partner/CHW presence | 15% | 5 = active CHW team and NGO support |\n|Population need (case counts/vaccination gap) | 15% | 5 = high unmet need; 0 = low |\n|Security & permitting | 10% | 5 = unrestricted; 0 = active security risk |\n|Onsite staffing capacity | 10% | 5 = existing vaccinators available |\n|Physical site suitability (space, water) | 5% | 5 = full suitability |\n\nScoring method\n- For each candidate site, compute weighted score out of 100. Shortlist top 3 sites subject to quick verification visit or remote verification call.\n\nSite constraints table (example template)\n| Site ID | Name | Score | Key constraints | Recommended immediate action |\n|---|---|---:|---|---|\n|S01 | Community Health Post A | 82 | No recent temp logs; power intermittent | Verify with temp-logger, deploy carriers with loggers, pre-position PCM |\n|S02 | Primary Clinic B | 74 | Road access limited in rainy season | Consider motorbike outreach team; pre-deploy extra carriers |\n|S03 | Market Outreach Site C | 69 | No fixed storage; strong CHW network | Use mobile outreach with vehicle and passive cold boxes |\n\n---\n\n## Monitoring & Evaluation \u2014 Key metrics (pilot)\n\nDefine metrics, calculation, and target ranges for pilot evaluation.\n\n1) Doses delivered per day and per site\n   - Definition: total number of vaccine doses administered at the pilot site in a calendar day.\n   - Target: pilot-dependent (e.g., 40\u2013100/day for mobile site).\n\n2) Cold-chain compliance: % time-in-range (2\u20138\u00b0C)\n   - Definition: percent of recorded temperature samples in the 2\u20138\u00b0C band for storage and carrier during operations.\n   - Calculation: (count_in_range / total_samples) * 100.\n   - Target: >95% for storage; >90% for carriers during outreach.\n\n3) Service uptime: % of scheduled clinic hours delivered\n   - Definition: actual hours of service delivered divided by scheduled hours.\n   - Target: >90%.\n\n4) Community uptake: attendees per outreach vs target population\n   - Definition: attendees per outreach event / (planned eligible population) * 100.\n   - Target: context-specific (initial target: 5\u201315% capture per outreach event depending on campaign).\n\n5) Adverse events reported and % appropriately handled\n   - Definition: number of AEFIs reported; percent meeting reporting and response SOP steps.\n   - Target: 100% of AEFIs reported and documented, 100% receive initial evaluation, severe events referred according to SOP.\n\n6) Cost per dose delivered (pilot-level)\n   - Definition: pilot total cost (equipment, consumables, per diem/staff, fuel) / doses delivered.\n   - Target: to be modeled in week 2 for scale comparisons.\n\nReporting cadence and formats\n- Daily site-level brief (one-page) with: doses administered, temp logger % time-in-range snapshots, service uptime, AEFIs, stock on hand and re-order needs.\n- Weekly consolidated dashboard with trend charts (doses/day, temp compliance trend, cost per dose estimates).\n\nData collection templates\n- Tally sheet (paper or digital) with fields: date, site, vaccinator name, vaccine type, dose number, batch/expiry, dose count, adverse events.\n- Cold-chain logger export README with sampling interval and timezone.\n\n---\n\n## Clinical SOP highlights (rapid orientation)\n\nThis section provides the core clinical SOP points that Marcos will expand into a 48-hour clinical SOP document.

transparent communication to community. |\n|Data quality issues for candidate site selection | Medium | Medium | Use conservative approach and on-site verification for ambiguous sites; use satellite imagery and CHW confirmation to supplement missing data. |\n\nEach mitigation item must be assigned an owner and an expected completion time.\n\n---\n\n## Procurement & logistics (quick action plan)\n\nImmediate procurement priorities (within 48 hours)\n- Vaccine carriers with validated temp-loggers (quantity for outreach teams and spares).\n- Passive cold boxes for fixed sites.\n- PCM packs (sufficient for outreach windows).\n- Temp loggers spare units.\n- Basic PPE, syringes, sharps boxes, and waste bags.\n- Lightweight tents or local shade shelter alternatives.\n\nProcurement path\n- Check existing GreenRiver-approved suppliers first for speed.\n- Local suppliers for tents, fuel, and small items to reduce lead time.\n- If import required for specific equipment (solar fridge, loggers), prioritize items that can be procured within procurement flex thresholds and expedite through emergency procurement channels.\n\nLogistics notes\n- Consolidate pick-up points; assign owner for last-mile logistics (recommended: logistics/driver per pilot).\n- Cold-chain transport planning: pre-condition PCM packs, check carrier temperatures before loading.\n\nCustoms/special permits\n- If importing solar fridges or temp-loggers, confirm customs lead times and whether duty waivers apply under emergency procurement.\n\n---\n\n## Next steps (immediate, for the client & team)\n\nImmediate actions (priority)\n1) Client: Provide the ten requested files and named RHA operations contact now via the shared folder or secure email.\n2) Oscar: Prepare and circulate the 24h technical note on cold-chain & shelter options; cc Marcos for clinical input.\n3) Alex: Confirm shapefile readiness and stand by to run GIS overlay once files arrive.\n4) Marcos: Draft the 48h clinical SOP and community engagement checklist and circulate for review.\n5) Sara: Confirm sponsor status and help expedite client provisioning of files/contacts.\n6) Lisa: Upon receipt of inputs, finalize the 48h memo and circulate for rapid review (target: within 6 hours of receiving inputs).\n\nCommunications plan for kickoff\n- Kickoff call invite to include: RHA operations contact, Sara, Lisa, Marcos, Oscar, Alex, local NGO/CHW leads (if available).\n- Shared folder created with version-controlled naming: GR_48h_Input_[date] and GR_48h_Deliverables_[date].\n\nDecision points and sign-off\n- Site shortlist finalized by Lisa with clinical sign-off from Marcos.\n- Equipment orders approved by Lisa after consultation with Oscar; procurement exceeding emergency thresholds to be escalated to Sara.\n\n---\n\n## Annex (attachments to be circulated when available)\n\n- Oscar: 24h technical note (cold-chain options, vaccine carriers, PCM calculation, solar fridge spec sheets).\n- Alex: GIS overlays and site-constraints table (upon receipt of shapefiles).\n- Marcos: Minimal clinical SOP & outreach script (AEFI checklist, quick vaccinator orientation).\n- Templates (to be circulated):\n  - CSV templates for case counts, cold-chain inventory, clinic list, transport assets.\n  - Daily site brief template (Excel/PDF).\n  - AEFI reporting form (PDF/printable).\n  - Consent/tally sheets (paper and digital formats).\n  - Procurement quick-BOM with supplier contacts where known.\n\nSample attachments list (placeholder filenames)\n- GR_CaseCounts_template.csv\n- GR_ColdChainInventory_template.csv\n- GR_ClinicList_template.csv\n- GR_TransportAssets_template.csv\n- Oscar_24h_TechnicalNote_v0.1.pdf\n- Marcos_ClinicalSOP_48h_draft_v0.1.pdf\n- Alex_GIS_Overlay_Initial.geojson\n\n---\n\nPrepared by: Lisa Carter (Lead/PM)  \nFor questions and to provide the requested files, please contact:\n\n- Lisa Carter \u2014 [email], +[phone], availability: 06:00\u201320:00 BRT  \n- Sara \u2014 sponsor contact: [email], +[phone]  \n- Marcos Almeida \u2014 clinical lead: [email], +[phone]  \n- Oscar \u2014 technical lead: [email], +[phone]  \n- Alex \u2014 GIS lead: [email], +[phone]\n\n---\n\nThis is a working draft intended for rapid iteration.
