    "content": "# MultiLever: Rapid Diagnostic & Action Plan\n\nAuthor: Lisa Carter (Wild Advice Partners)  \nDate: (prepared immediately)\n\n---\n\n## Executive summary (expanded)\n\nSituation summary\n- Over the last quarter MultiLever has observed approximately a 10% increase in input costs and an approximately 20% drop in consumer demand concentrated in three core categories: Food, Home Appliances, and Toys. The demand contraction is uneven across channels and cohorts (strongest in cash-constrained households and in lower-throughput rural/peri-urban sites). Freight and packaging costs represent much of the input inflation; some supplier contracts show spot-price increases and lengthened lead-times.\n- Client objective: identify immediate, pragmatic, low-risk levers to arrest demand decline and protect contribution margins within a near-term window (2\u20138 weeks), while preserving brand trust and pilot feasibility.\n\nShort recommendation (one-line)\n- Run a tightly scoped 2-week rapid pilot that combines pack-sizing changes, targeted promotional experiments, and prioritized procurement (including passive PCM kits for cold-sensitive items where relevant) while simultaneously modelling elasticity and margin impacts. Immediate cross-functional coordination is required: Procurement (Sara), Site/GIS (Alex), Technical/BOM (Oscar), Client Branding (GreenRiver), Clinical sign-off (Marcos). Convene a 24\u201372 hour rapid execution cell to ensure pilot readiness.\n\nKey expected outcomes of pilot\n- Faster validation of price sensitivity and channel elasticities for prioritized SKUs (within 10\u201314 days of pilot start).\n- Short-term demand recovery of 5\u201312% in targeted segments (projected based on moderate elasticity scenarios), with controllable margin impact through targeted promotions.\n- A prioritized procurement map that minimizes single-point-of-failure exposure for rollout scale-up.\n\nThis document contains:\n- a concise diagnostic approach and expected deliverables,\n- immediate 24\u201372h \u201cmust do\u201d actions and checklists to preserve pilot feasibility,\n- modelling and scenario planning methodology and example outputs,\n- prioritized short-term tactics with estimated impacts and owners,\n- a two-week pilot implementation plan with SOPs, staffing, monitoring metrics and budgets,\n- explicit owners, timelines and decision gates,\n- an expanded risk register with triggers and mitigations,\n- templates and appendices for rapid use (procurement brief, BOM, experiment plan, community messaging, checklists).\n\n---\n\n## Background & problem statement (expanded)\n\nObserved indicators\n- Input inflation: approximately +10% overall; concentrated increases in packaging (up to +15%), freight (+12\u201325 depending on lane), and select raw inputs (some up to +18%).\n- Demand: ~20% quarter-over-quarter drop in observed sales volumes across Food, Home Appliances, and Toys. Drop is heterogeneous: Food shows more resilience in urban channels; Home Appliances & Toys show steeper decline in discretionary purchasers.\n- Channel shifts: increased share of lower-value micro-retail channels; reduced high-value purchases through subscription/loyalty cohorts.\n- Operational constraints: some suppliers reporting 2\u20136 week lead-times; R&D capacity available but needs focused brief to deliver rapid feasibility inputs.\n\nClient objective and constraints\n- Recover demand and preserve margins within 2\u20138 weeks.\n- Maintain clinical and brand trust (GreenRiver constraints around co-branding).\n- Procurement and supplier lead-times may limit certain interventions; emergency procurement routes must be mapped.\n\nPrimary hypothesis for demand shortfall (to be tested in diagnostic)\n- Combination of price-channel-income effects: reduced real purchasing power + suboptimal pack-sizing (pack sizes too large for constrained shoppers) + competitor promotions.\n- Operational frictions (stockouts at key micro-retail sites) magnify the observed demand drop.\n\n---\n\n## Quick diagnostic approach (recommended, 5 business days) \u2014 detailed plan\n\nOverall objective: deliver a one-page diagnostic plus a 10\u201320 page data appendix within 5 business days that attributes demand change to primary drivers and produces prioritized pilot SKU list.\n\nDay-by-day plan (0\u20135 business days)\n- Day 0 (kickoff, within 6 hours): Confirm data access, owners and immediate 24\u201372h deliverables. Convene 1-hour touchpoint with Alex, Oscar, Sara, GreenRiver, Marcos.\n- Day 1: Ingest sales/transaction data. Produce initial sales decompositions by SKU, channel, geography, cohort. Identify top 50 SKUs by revenue and top 30 by volume.\n- Day 2: Compute top-down elasticity proxies using historical price promotions and competitor observed pricing (if available). Begin bottom-up elasticity model preparation for highest-volume SKUs.\n- Day 3: Attribute change drivers using regression decomposition and difference-in-differences where possible (to separate competitor promotions and channel reallocation from price/income effects).\n- Day 4: Produce top-3 drivers per category and prioritize candidate SKUs for pilot (pack-size candidates, high-margin vs high-volume tradeoffs).\n- Day 5: Finalize one-page diagnostic and appendix, circulate to partners.\n\nTasks and owners (summary)\n- Descriptive analytics (sales decomposition): Owner Lisa (lead), Alex (data ingestion & preprocessing).\n- Elasticity estimates: Owner Lisa (statistical models); Alex to provide channel/cohort data; procurement costs from Sara & Oscar.\n- Driver prioritization: Owner Lisa. Deliverable: top-3 drivers per category, pilot SKU shortlist.\n\nDeliverable format\n- One-page executive diagnostic (PDF) summarizing key numbers, top drivers, and 8\u201312 bullet tactical recommendations.\n- Data appendix: tables and charts by SKU/channel/cohort, model outputs (elasticity point estimates + uncertainty), list of recommended pilot SKUs and rationales.\n\nSample deliverable outline (for the one-page diagnostic)\n- Header: date, author, data coverage (dates), sample size.\n- Key metrics: % change volumes, % change input costs, top 10 SKUs impacted.\n- Drivers: ranked top 3 per category with short evidence lines.\n- Pilot recommendation: 2-week pilot scope and target metrics (lift, conversion, margin guardrails).\n- Immediate asks: GreenRiver branding, Oscar BOM, Sara procurement envelope, Alex site mapping.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate (24\u201372h) asks to preserve pilot feasibility \u2014 detailed checklist and templates\n\nThese items are required to proceed with procurement and field readiness.

R&D to produce feasibility and regulatory implications.\n- Outputs: yes/no feasibility, estimated cost savings per unit, estimated lead-time for reformulated pack.\n\nDeliverable: scenario deck\n- Contents: elasticity results with uncertainty, scenario modeling tables, sensitivity checks, prioritized interventions ranked by incremental margin per dollar spent and projected incremental volume.\n- Delivery timeframe: 2\u20133 weeks.\n\nExample modelling results (illustrative \u2014 to be replaced with live numbers)\n- SKU A (Food staple): baseline weekly volume 5,000 units; estimated price elasticity = -0.9 (90% CI: -0.6 to -1.2). A 10% price reduction expected to increase volume by ~9% (range 6\u201312%). With pack-size reduction of 25% and 10% price cut, expected conversion of new buyers from price-sensitive cohorts ~14% uplift; margin compression estimated at 4 pp but net contribution may improve if increased volume reduces cost-to-serve per unit.\n- SKU B (Toy): baseline weekly 1,200 units; elasticity = -1.6 (highly price-sensitive). A modest 5% price cut + targeted loyalty promo predicted to increase volume 8\u201310% but with higher cannibalization from off-promo periods.\n\nScenario table (example)\n\n| Scenario | Intervention | Expected Vol Change | Margin impact (pp) | Key risks |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---|\n| A | Introduce 25% smaller pack at 20% lower shelf price (Food) | +12% (range 8\u201316) | -3 pp | Packaging lead-time; consumer confusion |\n| B | Targeted 15% promo to loyalty cohort (Home Appliances) | +6% (range 3\u20139) | -2 pp | Spillover to non-target channels |\n| C | Tactical A/B 20% price cut for 7 days on 5 SKUs (Toys) | +18% (range 10\u201325) | -8 pp | High margin erosion if not targeted |\n\nNote: all numbers above are illustrative and will be replaced with model outputs when the data is ingested.\n\nModel quality assurance and sensitivity checks\n- Cross-validate models on historical promotion events.\n- Use hierarchical pooling to stabilize estimates for low-volume SKUs.\n- Perform counterfactual checks comparing non-promoted control stores/sites.\n\nDecision rules informed by modelling\n- Only scale price promotions if projected uplift yields net contribution improvement or meets client tolerance thresholds (e.g., no >5 pp long-term margin erosion unless strategic).\n- Pack-size interventions preferred where they reduce immediate consumer price barrier without large incremental packaging cost.\n\n---\n\n## Short-term tactics (prioritized and expanded)\n\nPriority ranking logic: highest expected net contribution per dollar of promotional spend + fastest operational lead-time.\n\n1) Adjust pack-sizing and introduce lower-price/value SKU variants\n- Rationale: reduces barrier to purchase by lowering absolute outlay per transaction; good for cash-constrained cohorts.\n- Implementation steps:\n  - Identify top 10 high-volume SKUs with potential for smaller pack option (Lisa + Oscar).\n  - Confirm packaging feasibility and incremental unit cost (Oscar + R&D).\n  - Produce label/packaging spec consistent with GreenRiver branding (GreenRiver sign-off required).\n  - Launch controlled in 1\u20132 channels/sites (pilot).\n- Estimated timeline: packaging fastest if in-house packaging stock available (2\u20137 days); otherwise 2+ weeks.\n- Expected effect: immediate affordability improvement; projected 8\u201315% lift in the most price-sensitive cohorts.\n\n2) Targeted promotions to high-ROI channels and cohorts\n- Rationale: limit promotional leakage and preserve margin by focusing offers to segments with highest response (loyal customers, value-seeking shoppers).\n- Implementation steps:\n  - Use loyalty data to define top 20% loyalty customers; craft coupon codes or SMS offers redeemable at selected sites.\n  - Allocate modest promo budget (e.g., 2\u20133% of expected weekly revenue in channel) to validate ROI.\n  - Monitor redemptions daily and cap program automatically if CPA exceeds threshold.\n- Measurement: incremental lift in redemption cohort vs matched control; incremental margin per redeemed unit.\n- Estimated timeline: 48\u201372 hours to configure offers and SMS/coupon distribution.\n\n3) Tactical price promotion experiments (A/B testing)\n- Rationale: quantify short-term price elasticity with controlled experiments to guide broader pricing strategy.\n- Experiment design:\n  - Randomize sites or households into control and treatment groups.\n  - Keep test duration small (7\u201310 days) to limit long-term margin exposure.\n  - Primary outcomes: incremental units sold, incremental revenue, margin impact.\n  - Power calculations: detect an absolute volume increase of 8% with 80% power given baseline variance \u2014 sample size calculations provided in Appendix C.\n- Owner: Commercial leads (execution), experiment design & analysis by Lisa.\n\n4) Cost-to-serve optimizations and SKU rationalization\n- Rationale: protect margins by reducing fulfillment costs and focusing assortment.\n- Tactics:\n  - Identify low-velocity, high-cost-to-serve SKUs to temporarily de-list or consolidate.\n  - Optimize delivery routes for pilot sites to reduce per-unit freight.\n  - Introduce local pick-up incentives where feasible.\n- Owner: Supply Chain & Sara.\n\n5) Loyalty and subscription pilots (medium-term)\n- Rationale: secure recurring revenue and shift purchase patterns from discretionary to habitual.\n- Approach:\n  - Pilot a 6\u20138 week subscription pilot for staple Food SKUs in 1 peri-urban and 1 community site.\n  - Incentivize initial sign-up with small discount; monitor retention beyond 4 weeks.\n- Owner: CRM/Engineering.\n\nR&D-driven tactics (if client has capacity)\n- Fast-track reformulation: look for ingredient substitutions or packaging adjustments to save small %s on cost-per-unit without impacting quality. Prioritize top-volume SKUs where a 2\u20134% per-unit cost reduction materially impacts margins.\n\nPrioritization matrix (example)\n\n| Tactic | Speed | Expected Lift | Margin Risk | Implementation Complexity |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---|\n| Pack-size | Fast\u2013Medium | Medium\u2013High | Low\u2013Medium | Medium |\n| Targeted promotions | Fast | Medium | Low | Low |\n| A/B price tests | Fast | Medium\u2013High | Medium | Low |\n| Cost-to-serve | Medium | Low\u2013Medium | Low | Medium\u2013High |\n| Subscription pilots | Medium\u2013Long | Medium | Low | High |\n\n---\n\n## Procurement & Pilot implementation notes (two-week pilot) \u2014 operational detail and BOM template\n\nPilot sites and throughput assumptions\n- Candidate sites (to be confirmed by Alex):\n  - Site 1 (Remote): throughput target 30\u201350 vials/day or equivalent unit flow. Logistics: single unpaved access road; nearest hub 6 hours by truck.\n  - Site 2 (Peri-urban): throughput target ~100 units/day; daily last-mile available.\n  - Site 3 (Community clinic): throughput target 100\u2013200 units/day; secure storage available; community leader engagement possible.\n\nPer-site BOM (example template)\n- The BOM must list all kit components, consumables and spare parts. Oscar to provide per-site variant counts. Below is an example BOM line format and sample row(s).\n\nBOM columns (required)\n- Item code | Item description | Qty per kit | Kits per site (2-week pilot) | Unit cost (USD) | Total cost | Supplier | Supplier lead-time (days) | Single-point-of-failure (Y/N) | Notes (packaging, cold sensitivity)\n\nSample BOM rows (illustrative)\n- KIT-001 | Passive PCM transport cooler (24h hold) | 1 | Remote: 20; Peri-urban: 40; Clinic: 80 | 35.00 | 5,040 | Supplier A | 10 days | N | Include 2 spare PCM blocks/site\n- LOG-002 | Temperature logger (digital) | 1 | Remote: 2; Peri-urban: 4; Clinic: 6 | 18.00 | 216 | Supplier B | 14 days | Y | Calibrated within 30d\n- PACK-010 | Consumer pack-size small (0.75x volume) | 1 | See per SKU | 0.85*base | varied | Supplier C | 5 days | N | Co-branding label area 45x20 mm\n\nProcurement prioritization triage (logic)\n- Triage A (order immediately): single-point-of-failure items, items without local substitutes, cold-chain equipment.\n- Triage B (order within 48 hours): standard consumables with >7 day lead-time.\n- Triage C (order if budget allows): non-essential promotional materials, extra spares.\n\nPacking, labelling and branding rules\n- Labeling: items with cold sensitivity must include explicit labelling (e.g., \"Keep between 2\u20138\u00b0C\", \"Do not freeze\"). Oscar to include label mockups; GreenRiver to approve co-branding placement (minimal presence on packaging as per sign-off).\n- Co-branding: minimal placement preferred \u2014 logo no larger than 25% of primary panel area; neutral background.\n\nStaffing & training\n- Per site staffing for pilot:\n  - Trainer: 1 (visits site for day 0 training).\n  - Community health workers: ~2 per site for operational tasks and basic AEFI flow.\n  - On-call clinical advisor (Marcos) for any clinical queries.\n- Training materials:\n  - 1-page quick reference for assembly & storage.\n  - 2-hour remote training session plus on-site 1-hour practical workshop.\n  - AEFI flow chart (Appendix D) with contact phone numbers.\n\nAssembly & check-in SOP (day-by-day)\n- Day -1: Site receives kits; local team verifies counts against BOM and takes photos; completes initial checklist and temperature log installation.\n- Day 0: On-site trainer conducts operational verification; cold-chain verification (temperature log check) and mock-run of client interaction.\n- Day 1\u201314: Daily morning check-ins (15 minutes) reporting throughput, stock consumption, logger temperatures and any incidents. Weekly review with Lisa/Oscar.\n\nMonitoring & data capture\n- Daily site report template (to be sent to shared drive):\n  - Date, Site ID, Throughput (units/day), Starting temperature, Average temp (24h), Number of kits used, Stock remaining, AEFI incidents (if any), Local promotions run.\n- Real-time ingestion: Alex to provide simple ingestion pipeline to capture CSVs. Lisa to run daily checks and provide updates to commercial leads.\n\nSpare parts & buffer policy\n- Maintain minimum buffer stock for single-point-of-failure items: 20% additional spares for PCM blocks and loggers.\n- If supply constrained, reallocate spares to highest-throughput site.\n\nSample per-site cost estimate (illustrative)\n- Site 1 (Remote): BOM cost $3,750 + freight $420 + training $350 + contingency 12% = $4,990\n- Site 2 (Peri-urban): BOM cost $6,800 + freight $360 + training $400 + contingency 10% = $7,680\n- Site 3 (Clinic): BOM cost $12,600 + freight $520 + training $450 + contingency 10% = $13,900\n- Pilot total (3 sites): ~$26,570 (illustrative; to be updated with actual BOM).\n\nProcurement checklist for Sara/Oscar\n- Confirm orderable supplier contacts and payment terms for each BOM line.\n- Confirm shipping ETA to each site and first-mile pickup slot for next 72 hours.\n- Confirm import/customs clearance needs (if cross-border).\n- Authorize emergency exception orders if necessary.\n\n---\n\n## Two-week pilot: day-by-day Gantt-style operational plan (textual)\n\nWeek 0 (preparation: 0\u201372 hours)\n- Hour 0\u20136: Kickoff meeting; Oscar shares BOM; GreenRiver confirms branding within 12h; Alex shares site shapefiles; Sara confirms procurement envelope.\n- Hour 6\u201348: Place urgent orders for Triage A items; initiate logistics bookings; trainer schedules.\n- Day 3: Receive first shipments to distribution hub; pack kits for each site; quality check.\n\nWeek 1 (pilot launch)\n- Day 4 (pilot day 0): Deliver kits to sites; trainer conducts on-site setup.\n- Day 5\u20137: Live pilot operations; targeted promotions go live per channel; begin A/B price tests in assigned sites.\n- Daily: collect site reports, check temperature logs, monitor redemption and sales.\n\nWeek 2 (pilot test & iterate)\n- Day 8\u201311: Continue operations; adjust promotions based on early signals (daily decision gate).\n- Day 12\u201313: Consolidate weekly interim analysis; run elasticity calculations on pilot data.\n- Day 14: Close experiments; final day for data capture; prepare final two-week pilot report and recommended next steps.\n\nDecision gates\n- Gate 1 (72 hours pre-launch): Bill of materials and branding sign-off completed \u2014 if not, proceed with reduced-scope pilot.\n- Gate 2 (Day 5): If daily throughput <50% of expected and no operational/stock issues identified, pause promotions and re-evaluate targeting.\n- Gate 3 (Day 10): If promotions show negative marginal contribution above threshold, stop promotions.\n\n---\n\n## Measurement, evaluation & KPIs\n\nPrimary KPIs\n- Volume change (units/day) per pilot SKU and site.\n- Conversion rate change (visits \u2192 purchases) where applicable.\n- Redemption rates for promotions and coupon ROI.\n- Contribution margin per unit and overall margin change for pilot SKUs.\n- Cold-chain compliance: % time within acceptable temperature band (e.g., 2\u20138\u00b0C for cold-sensitive items).\n- Operational uptime: % days with full kit availability.\n\nSecondary KPIs\n- Customer satisfaction (short exit questionnaire for buyers: net promoter-like 5-point).\n- AEFI incidents (if relevant): count and severity; time to resolution.\n- Supplier lead-time adherence.\n\nData collection instruments\n- Daily site report CSV (fields: date, site_id, sku_id, units_sold, units_dispensed, starting_temp, ending_temp, #coupons_redeemed, incidents).\n- Short customer feedback form (3 questions: price perception, pack-size satisfaction, overall satisfaction).\n- Incident report template for AEFI & operational problems.\n\nDashboard & reporting cadence\n- Daily snapshot (email) of critical KPIs to leads (Lisa, Oscar, Sara).\n- Interim analysis at Day 7 with initial elasticity signals.\n- Final pilot report at Day 14 with recommendation to scale or adapt.\n\nExperiment analysis plan (A/B tests)\n- Primary endpoint: % change in weekly units sold for SKU in treatment vs control.\n- Statistical test: difference-in-differences using site-level daily panel; cluster-robust standard errors.\n- Power analysis: given baseline average daily sales of 200 units per site for SKU, standard deviation 40, to detect 8% absolute change at alpha=0.05, power=0.8, need n\u22488 sites per arm OR extend test duration.

use conservative (wide) priors in Bayesian models.\n  - Use hierarchical pooling to borrow strength across SKUs.\n  - Use quick proxy metrics (store-level trends) where SKU-level is unavailable.\n- Owner: Lisa + Alex.\n\nRisk 4: Margin erosion from promotions\n- Trigger: Promotions yield marginal contribution below pre-defined threshold (e.g., <20% of cost-of-promo).\n- Mitigation:\n  - Run controlled A/B experiments and stop promotions that don\u2019t meet ROI criteria.\n  - Prefer targeted promotions to high-ROI cohorts to minimize leakage.\n- Owner: Lisa + Marketing.\n\nRisk 5: Cold-chain failure (temperature excursions)\n- Trigger: Logger records temperature outside acceptable band for >2 hours.\n- Mitigation:\n  - Immediate quarantine of affected product; trigger rapid re-supply from hub.\n  - Use passive PCM kits and additional insulation for remote shipments.\n  - Re-train site teams on storage checks and response.\n- Owner: Oscar + site trainer.\n\nRisk 6: AEFI incidents or clinical safety events\n- Trigger: Any moderate/severe AEFI reported.\n- Mitigation:\n  - Immediate clinical triage and reporting protocol (Marcos).\n  - Pause distribution if cluster identified;

If you have questions, speak to your local health worker or call [hotline].\u201d\n\n---\n\n## Next steps (practical, immediate)\n\nAction list (immediate; owners & deadlines)\n1) Oscar: send procurement-ready BOM + one-page procurement brief within ~6 hours; flag any lead-times >2 weeks. (Owner: Oscar)\n2) GreenRiver: confirm branding approach (signed short approval letter + minimal co-branding preferred) within 12 hours. (Owner: GreenRiver)\n3) Sara: send emergency envelope amount and permitted procurement routes / approved supplier list within 24 hours. (Owner: Sara)\n4) Alex: confirm site-to-throughput mapping and share shapefiles within 12 hours. (Owner: Alex)\n5) Lisa: compile package and circulate to Marcos for clinical sign-off within 1 hour of receiving the above inputs. (Owner: Lisa)\n\nDecision points and timelines\n- T=0+12h: If branding & site mapping not complete, proceed with internal-only packaging and minimal branding while escalating.\n- T=0+24h: If procurement envelope not confirmed, scale down pilot and prioritize Triage A items.\n\n---\n\n## Appendix (templates, checklists, and technical details)\n\nAppendix A \u2014 Branding sign-off template (one-paragraph)\n- \"I, Dr. Amina Khan (GreenRiver), authorize minimal co-branding for the MultiLever pilot kits. Co-branding shall be limited to a single small logo no greater than X mm on the side panel. GreenRiver approves the following placement/colour specifications: [specs]. This approval is valid for the two-week pilot period only.
