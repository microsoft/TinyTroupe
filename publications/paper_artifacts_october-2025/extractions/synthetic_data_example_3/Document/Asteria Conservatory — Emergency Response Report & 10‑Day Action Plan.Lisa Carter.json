    "content": "# Asteria Conservatory \u2014 Emergency Response Report & 10\u2011Day Action Plan\n\nDate: Day 0 (urgent)  \nAuthor: Lisa Carter, Wild Advice Partners (M365 Search / analytics lead on this engagement)\n\n---\n\n## Executive summary (expanded)\n\nAsteria Conservatory has experienced the sudden withdrawal of a major grant, creating an immediate cash shortfall that threatens staff positions, artist fees, and core programming. This document is an urgent, operational playbook to: (1) rapidly establish facts (48\u201372 hours); (2) stabilize cash runway through short\u2011term cost controls and reversible earned\u2011revenue pilots (Day 0\u201310); (3) protect mission and artist relationships through explicit guardrails; and (4) prepare communications for donors, sponsors, staff, and board.\n\nThis report contains:\n- A 48\u2011hour urgent checklist with owners, deadlines, and required artifacts.\n- A prioritized Day 0\u201310 action plan with step\u2011by\u2011step tasks, decision gates, and owners.\n- Templates: Financial Triage Memo, Pilot P&L, Stakeholder Interview Script, Donor One\u2011Pager and sample outreach messages.\n- KPI definitions, measurement approach, and tracking templates for pilots.\n- A risk register with mitigations and contingency options.\n- Detailed operational checklists for suggested pilots (pop\u2011ups, classes, rentals, streaming).\n- A recommended cadence for team coordination and board briefings.\n\nPrimary objective for the next 10 days: restore runway sufficiently to avoid involuntary layoffs, while buying time to negotiate sponsorships, restructure longer\u2011term funding, and pursue strategic fundraising. Priority metric: incremental cash collected within 30 days.\n\n---\n\n## Problem statement (expanded)\n\n- Recent event: withdrawal of a major institutional grant. Details (reason, timing, reclaimability) are still TBD \u2014 these must be clarified within 48 hours.\n- Immediate consequences:\n  - Cash shortfall affecting next payroll cycle and supplier payments.\n  - High likelihood of staff furloughs or layoffs if runway is not extended.\n  - Risk to scheduled programs if vendor deposits or artist fees cannot be met.\n- Strategic tension: some revenue actions (e.g., commercial rentals, price changes) can generate income quickly but risk donor alienation or harm to reputation if handled insensitively.\n- Primary objective (Day 0\u201310): execute a prioritized mix of immediate cost control, rapid earned\u2011revenue experiments that are reversible, and targeted high\u2011touch donor/sponsor outreach to bridge the gap. Preserve artistic integrity and artist compensation while maximizing short\u2011term liquidity.\n\n---\n\n## Key constraints and known unknowns (must confirm within 48h)\n\n1. Cash & accounting\n   - Current bank balance and cleared balances (checking, savings).\n   - Timing of upcoming payroll, rent, utilities, and vendor payments.\n   - Any restricted funds / net asset restrictions that prevent redeployment.\n\n2. Grants & contracts\n   - Terms of the withdrawn grant (notice period, clawback clauses, reporting status).\n   - Other grant contract restrictions (how funds may/cannot be used).\n   - Any contractual commitments to artists or partners with penalties for cancellation.\n\n3. Human resources\n   - Payroll schedule, benefits obligations, legally required notice for layoffs.\n   - Staffing criticality (who is essential to keep on to operate pilots).\n\n4. Operational capacity\n   - Venue technical capacity (AV, streaming, staging).\n   - Ticketing platform capabilities and access to donor CRM.\n   - Marketing channels and digital access (social accounts, email lists).\n\n5. External stakeholder sentiment\n   - Board stance and appetite for temporary earned revenue or restructuring.\n   - Donor sensitivity to messaging about financial distress.\n\n---\n\n## Immediate 48\u2011hour checklist (urgent asks \u2014 owners & deadlines; expanded)\n\nBelow is an action list prioritized to establish fact base, protect runway, and create an operating folder for shared collaboration.\n\nTable: 48\u2011Hour Urgent Checklist (summary)\n\n| # | Task | Owner | Deadline | Required outputs / acceptance criteria |\n|---|------|-------|----------|-----------------------------------------|\n| 1 | Folder & ED contact | Lisa | +24h | Shared folder created (Asteria / WildAdvice); ED contact details; SSO/permissions; snapshot of where core files will live |\n| 2 | Financial snapshot (triage memo start) | Lisa (lead) / Asteria ops | 48\u201372h | Draft Financial Triage Memo with cash balance, 3 scenario runways, top fixed costs, payroll/rent obligations |\n| 3 | Program & ticketing pull | Alex | 24h | CSV: events (last 18 months), attendance, gross/net ticket revenue, promo codes, refunds, channel of sale |\n| 4 | Payroll & HR pull | Lisa (coord) / Asteria HR | 24\u201348h | Staff roster with role, FTE, salary, next payroll date, benefits cost, union/contract obligations |\n| 5 | Venue ops & retrofit checklist | Oscar | 48h | List of low\u2011cost revenue opportunities, cost/time estimates, minimum additional staff required |\n| 6 | Stakeholder interviews | Marcos | Start within 24h after ED contact; complete Day 0\u20132 | 4\u20136 interviews with artists, staff, community leaders; summary of appetite for pilots and constraints |\n| 7 | Partnership & sponsorship sweep (initial) | Sara | Initial shortlist Day 6 (but begin Day 0) | Rapid list of 10 local/corp prospects, suggested ask levels and matching opportunities |\n| 8 | Legal & contract review | Lisa / legal (if available) | 48\u201372h | Identify any agreements that limit earned revenue, inform layoffs, or produce penalties |\n| 9 | Communications (internal staff message draft) | Lisa / ED | 24h | Draft internal message to staff from ED \u2014 empathetic, transparent, sets expectations for next 72h |\n| 10 | Cash\u2011conserving immediate actions (list) | Lisa / ED | 24\u201348h | Freeze non\u2011essential spend list; hold on new hires, discretionary travel, subscriptions; formal approval channel |\n\nDetailed sub\u2011tasks and templates follow in the Appendix sections.\n\nKey notes:\n- Prioritize tasks to produce artifacts that enable rapid decision making: cash balance, payroll timing, top 8 fixed costs by monthly value, and a clean roster with FTE.\n- Access: ask Asteria ops for view\u2011only access to accounting (or exported statements) rather than full account credentials.

Attendance / capacity (%)\n   - Definition: Paid attendance divided by venue capacity for each event.\n   - Goal threshold: pilot target \u2265 40% paid capacity (adjust by pilot type).\n\n2. Net revenue per event\n   - Definition: Sum(ticket revenue + sponsorship revenue + add\u2011ons + rentals) \u2212 marginal costs (artist fees, event staff, incremental AV, marketing).\n   - Unit: USD per event; calculated at event close.\n\n3. Incremental cash collected within 30 days (priority metric)\n   - Definition: Any cash deposited into Asteria bank account within 30 days that would not have otherwise occurred.\n   - Acceptance threshold: pilot should be able to produce a projected incremental cash >= payroll for 1 week (or alternative threshold set by ED/board).\n\n4. Artist satisfaction\n   - Measurement: Post\u2011pilot artist survey (scale 1\u20135), plus qualitative comments.\n   - Desired result: average \u2265 4.0; any score < 3 requires immediate follow\u2011up.\n\n5. Donor sentiment (qualitative)\n   - Measurement: notes from donor conversations; simple rating of sentiment (Supportive / Neutral / Concerned).\n   - Use: inform messaging and larger asks.\n\n6. Conversion metrics (for tickets & streaming)\n   - Email open rate | CTA click\u2011through | Checkout conversion rate.\n\n7. Operational burden\n   - Metric: staff hours per event / marginal ops cost.\n   - Use: ensure pilots are not consuming more staff time than revenue justifies.\n\nSuggested KPI dashboard columns (to be maintained in shared sheet):\n- Pilot name | Date | Owner | Paid attendees | Capacity % | Gross revenue | Sponsorship revenue | Add\u2011ons | Marginal costs | Net revenue | Cash collected within 30 days | Artist satisfaction score | Notes\n\nMeasurement cadence:\n- Real\u2011time daily cash tally during execution week.\n- Post\u2011event 48\u2011hour close: finalize P&L and deposit confirmation.\n- Day 10 synthesis: pilot comparison table and recommendation.\n\n---\n\n## Guardrails (mission protection \u2014 detailed)\n\nAll pilots and revenue actions must follow these guardrails to protect Asteria\u2019s mission and relationships:\n\n1. Reversibility\n   - Any pilot that modifies programming must be explicitly labeled \u201cpilot; reversible\u201d and requires board signoff to become permanent.\n\n2. Artist compensation\n   - Minimum artist revenue share: no artist should receive less than their previously agreed fee unless they opt into lower share with written consent.\n   - Transparent splits: provide artists with the breakdown of grosss-to-net and timelines for payment.\n\n3. Donor transparency\n   - Donor communications must emphasize temporary nature of measures and highlight commitment to core mission.\n   - Avoid language implying permanent pivot to commercialization.\n\n4. Audience experience\n   - Maintain quality standards for public events; do not reduce production values in visible ways that would harm reputation.\n\n5. Pricing ethics\n   - Any price increases must be accompanied by subsidized options (pay\u2011what\u2011you\u2011can or student/community discounts) to preserve accessibility.\n\n6. Approval thresholds\n   - Non\u2011core program cancellations or staff layoffs require signoff by ED + Board Chair (unless immediate payroll cannot be met; see emergency protocol).\n\n---\n\n## Donor communications one\u2011pager \u2014 full template and suggested wording\n\nThis one\u2011pager is intended to be adapted into a short email or conversation script and should be co\u2011signed by Lisa and the ED where possible.\n\nSubject line suggestions:\n- Asteria update and a request for interim support\n- Urgent: short\u2011term bridge support request for Asteria Conservatory\n\nBody template (recommended phrasing):\n\nOpening / Thanks\n- \"Dear [Donor Name], thank you for your long\u2011standing support of Asteria Conservatory.

Populate with validated numbers and highlight assumptions.\n\nMemo sections:\n1. Executive snapshot (1 page)\n   - Current unrestricted cash: $[placeholder]\n   - Days of runway (base scenario): [x] days\n   - Immediate obligations due within 14 days: payroll $[x], rent $[x], vendor $[x]\n   - Highest\u2011priority recommendation (e.g., secure bridge gift, freeze discretionary spend, run 2 pilots)\n\n2. Cash balance & bank statement evidence\n   - Attach/insert screenshots or PDF of bank balance verifications.\n\n3. Scenarios (assumptions must be listed)\n   - Base scenario: current burn rate (exclude discretionary spend) \u2192 runway formula: Unrestricted cash / monthly net burn \u00d7 30 = days runway.\n   - Conservative scenario: assumes 10% drop in projected ticket revenue; increased rent or vendor reserve.\n   - Optimistic scenario: assumes successful sponsor underwriting + pilot grossing.\n\nExample calculation (illustrative template only \u2014 fill with actuals):\n- Unrestricted cash = $60,000\n- Monthly fixed burn (payroll + rent + fixed) = $45,000\n- Monthly variable (program-dependent) = $15,000\n- Net monthly burn = $60,000\n- Base runway = 60,000 / 60,000 \u00d7 30 = 30 days\n\n4. Immediate obligations (next 14 days)\n   - Payroll run date: [MM/DD]; total payroll = $[x]\n   - Rent due [MM/DD] = $[x]\n   - Vendor deposits / grant reporting deliverables = $[x]\n\n5. Recommended immediate actions (ranked)\n   - Freeze non\u2011critical spend (list items).\n   - Negotiate with bank/landlord for short deferral.\n   - Fast donor outreach to top 10 donors with one\u2011pager.\n   - Launch 1\u20132 reversible pilots for quick cash (list candidates).\n   - Board/ED: convene emergency meeting within 48\u201372 hours.\n\n6. Sensitivities and contingency paths\n   - If runway < 14 days: require immediate donor push + discuss temporary staff reductions (informed by HR/legal).\n   - If pilots underperform (less than 50% expected net rev): trigger second donor wave + consider short\u2011term lines of credit.\n\n7. Appendices\n   - Detailed cashflow by day/week for 60 days.\n   - List of fixed cost lines with monthly values.\n   - Contacts for payroll, bank, landlord.\n\n---\n\n## Pilot prioritization & P&L template (operational)\n\nWhen evaluating pilots, use a common P&L template to compare:\n\nPilot P&L template (columns and example rows):\n\n- Pilot name: [e.g., Curated Ticketed Pop\u2011Up]\n- Date(s): [MM/DD]\n- Capacity: [e.g., 80]\n- Expected paid attendance: [e.g., 40\u201360]\n- Pricing tiers: General $20 | Supporter $50 | Student $10\n- Gross ticket revenue (est): = Sum(tickets sold \u00d7 price)\n- Sponsorship underwriting (if any): $[x]\n- Add\u2011ons revenue (donations, concessions, merch): $[x]\n- Marginal costs:\n  - Artist fees: $[x]\n  - Event staff (per event): $[x]\n  - AV incremental: $[x]\n  - Marketing (social boost + poster): $[x]\n  - Payment fees (var %): $[x]\n- Net revenue (Gross + Sponsorship + Add\u2011ons \u2212 Marginal costs) = $[x]\n- Cash collection timing: deposit date(s)\n- Net contribution to runway within 30 days: $[x]\n\nIllustrative example (fill with real numbers during Day 3\u20136):\n- Capacity 80, expected paid 50 at average $20 = $1,000\n- Sponsorship: $2,500 underwriting\n- Add\u2011ons: $200\n- Marginal costs: $1,200\n- Net revenue = $1,000 + $2,500 + $200 \u2212 $1,200 = $2,500\n\nUse the P&L to compare pilots by:\n- Speed to cash (days to collect)\n- Net revenue margin (%)\n- Staff hours required per $ revenue\n- Mission fit (qualitative)\n\n---\n\n## Pilot ops pack \u2014 checklist (sample SOP for a pop\u2011up concert)\n\nPre\u2011event (T\u20117 to T\u20111)\n- Confirm artist contracts and 50% deposit policies (if applicable).\n- Confirm venue configuration and FOH.\n- Ticketing: create event in ticketing platform; set up tiers & promo codes.\n- Refund policy: clearly published; define handling of comps.\n- Marketing: create two email sends + 3 social posts; allocate $100\u2013$300 for boosted posts.\n- Staffing: assign event producer, FOH lead, box office, house tech.\n- Supplies: print programs (if any), signage, merchandise stock.\n\nDay of event\n- Arrival and load in schedule.\n- Sound check window & checklists.\n- Box office reconciliation & cash handling plan.\n- Artist settlement: ensure artist checks/transfer method.\n- Collection: ensure all ticketing deposits are processed and tracked.\n\nPost\u2011event (T+1 to T+3)\n- Reconcile gross receipts to bank deposit.\n- Fill P&L template and upload to shared folder.\n- Send artist satisfaction survey and collect results.\n- Quick debrief call (30 minutes) for operational learnings.\n\n---\n\n## Venue retrofit & low\u2011cost utilization ideas (Oscar \u2014 expanded)\n\nPriority opportunities (low CapEx, fast to implement):\n1. Weekend rental packages for community groups & corporate offsites\n   - Minimal staffing; rental fee tiers (half\u2011day, full\u2011day).\n   - Quick marketing to local schools and creative collectives.\n\n2. Curated ticketed pop\u2011up series\n   - Targeted programing for local audiences with pay\u2011what\u2011you\u2011can/paid tiers.\n\n3. Community masterclasses / intensive workshops\n   - Small cohorts, higher per\u2011participant price, with artist revenue share.\n\n4. Streaming + slight paywall\n   - Test a pay\u2011per\u2011view live stream or voluntary donation model for recorded performances.\n\n5. Co\u2011working or rehearsal space rentals\n   - Daytime idle hours can be monetized for rehearsals and co\u2011working.\n\n6.
