# Asteria Conservatory — Emergency Response Report & 10‑Day Action Plan

Date: Day 0 (urgent)  
Author: Lisa Carter, Wild Advice Partners (M365 Search / analytics lead on this engagement)

---

## Executive summary (expanded)

Asteria Conservatory has experienced the sudden withdrawal of a major grant, creating an immediate cash shortfall that threatens staff positions, artist fees, and core programming. This document is an urgent, operational playbook to: (1) rapidly establish facts (48–72 hours); (2) stabilize cash runway through short‑term cost controls and reversible earned‑revenue pilots (Day 0–10); (3) protect mission and artist relationships through explicit guardrails; and (4) prepare communications for donors, sponsors, staff, and board.

This report contains:
- A 48‑hour urgent checklist with owners, deadlines, and required artifacts.
- A prioritized Day 0–10 action plan with step‑by‑step tasks, decision gates, and owners.
- Templates: Financial Triage Memo, Pilot P&L, Stakeholder Interview Script, Donor One‑Pager and sample outreach messages.
- KPI definitions, measurement approach, and tracking templates for pilots.
- A risk register with mitigations and contingency options.
- Detailed operational checklists for suggested pilots (pop‑ups, classes, rentals, streaming).
- A recommended cadence for team coordination and board briefings.

Primary objective for the next 10 days: restore runway sufficiently to avoid involuntary layoffs, while buying time to negotiate sponsorships, restructure longer‑term funding, and pursue strategic fundraising. Priority metric: incremental cash collected within 30 days.

---

## Problem statement (expanded)

- Recent event: withdrawal of a major institutional grant. Details (reason, timing, reclaimability) are still TBD — these must be clarified within 48 hours.
- Immediate consequences:
  - Cash shortfall affecting next payroll cycle and supplier payments.
  - High likelihood of staff furloughs or layoffs if runway is not extended.
  - Risk to scheduled programs if vendor deposits or artist fees cannot be met.
- Strategic tension: some revenue actions (e.g., commercial rentals, price changes) can generate income quickly but risk donor alienation or harm to reputation if handled insensitively.
- Primary objective (Day 0–10): execute a prioritized mix of immediate cost control, rapid earned‑revenue experiments that are reversible, and targeted high‑touch donor/sponsor outreach to bridge the gap. Preserve artistic integrity and artist compensation while maximizing short‑term liquidity.

---

## Key constraints and known unknowns (must confirm within 48h)

1. Cash & accounting
   - Current bank balance and cleared balances (checking, savings).
   - Timing of upcoming payroll, rent, utilities, and vendor payments.
   - Any restricted funds / net asset restrictions that prevent redeployment.

2. Grants & contracts
   - Terms of the withdrawn grant (notice period, clawback clauses, reporting status).
   - Other grant contract restrictions (how funds may/cannot be used).
   - Any contractual commitments to artists or partners with penalties for cancellation.

3. Human resources
   - Payroll schedule, benefits obligations, legally required notice for layoffs.
   - Staffing criticality (who is essential to keep on to operate pilots).

4. Operational capacity
   - Venue technical capacity (AV, streaming, staging).
   - Ticketing platform capabilities and access to donor CRM.
   - Marketing channels and digital access (social accounts, email lists).

5. External stakeholder sentiment
   - Board stance and appetite for temporary earned revenue or restructuring.
   - Donor sensitivity to messaging about financial distress.

## KPIs & measurement (expanded and operationalized)

Priority metrics (tracked per pilot and in aggregate):

1. Attendance / capacity (%)
   - Definition: Paid attendance divided by venue capacity for each event.
   - Goal threshold: pilot target ≥ 40% paid capacity (adjust by pilot type).

2. Net revenue per event
   - Definition: Sum(ticket revenue + sponsorship revenue + add‑ons + rentals) − marginal costs (artist fees, event staff, incremental AV, marketing).
   - Unit: USD per event; calculated at event close.

3. Incremental cash collected within 30 days (priority metric)
   - Definition: Any cash deposited into Asteria bank account within 30 days that would not have otherwise occurred.
   - Acceptance threshold: pilot should be able to produce a projected incremental cash >= payroll for 1 week (or alternative threshold set by ED/board).

4. Artist satisfaction
   - Measurement: Post‑pilot artist survey (scale 1–5), plus qualitative comments.
   - Desired result: average ≥ 4.0; any score < 3 requires immediate follow‑up.

5. Donor sentiment (qualitative)
   - Measurement: notes from donor conversations; simple rating of sentiment (Supportive / Neutral / Concerned).
   - Use: inform messaging and larger asks.

6. Conversion metrics (for tickets & streaming)
   - Email open rate | CTA click‑through | Checkout conversion rate.

7. Operational burden
   - Metric: staff hours per event / marginal ops cost.
   - Use: ensure pilots are not consuming more staff time than revenue justifies.

Suggested KPI dashboard columns (to be maintained in shared sheet):
- Pilot name | Date | Owner | Paid attendees | Capacity % | Gross revenue | Sponsorship revenue | Add‑ons | Marginal costs | Net revenue | Cash collected within 30 days | Artist satisfaction score | Notes

Measurement cadence:
- Real‑time daily cash tally during execution week.
- Post‑event 48‑hour close: finalize P&L and deposit confirmation.
- Day 10 synthesis: pilot comparison table and recommendation.

---

## Guardrails (mission protection — detailed)

All pilots and revenue actions must follow these guardrails to protect Asteria’s mission and relationships:

1. Reversibility
   - Any pilot that modifies programming must be explicitly labeled “pilot; reversible” and requires board signoff to become permanent.

2. Artist compensation
   - Minimum artist revenue share: no artist should receive less than their previously agreed fee unless they opt into lower share with written consent.
   - Transparent splits: provide artists with the breakdown of grosss-to-net and timelines for payment.

3. Donor transparency
   - Donor communications must emphasize temporary nature of measures and highlight commitment to core mission.
   - Avoid language implying permanent pivot to commercialization.

4. Audience experience
   - Maintain quality standards for public events; do not reduce production values in visible ways that would harm reputation.

5. Pricing ethics
   - Any price increases must be accompanied by subsidized options (pay‑what‑you‑can or student/community discounts) to preserve accessibility.

6. Approval thresholds
   - Non‑core program cancellations or staff layoffs require signoff by ED + Board Chair (unless immediate payroll cannot be met; see emergency protocol).

## Donor communications one‑pager — full template and suggested wording

This one‑pager is intended to be adapted into a short email or conversation script and should be co‑signed by Lisa and the ED where possible.

Subject line suggestions:
- Asteria update and a request for interim support
- Urgent: short‑term bridge support request for Asteria Conservatory

Body template (recommended phrasing):

Opening / Thanks
- "Dear [Donor Name], thank you for your long‑standing support of Asteria Conservatory. Because of supporters like you, we have been able to [one‑line mission impact]."

Transparency & Situation
- "We are writing with an important and urgent update. A major institutional grant that has supported [program/area] has been withdrawn. The Conservatory’s leadership is completing a financial triage and pursuing short‑term measures to protect artists and staff while maintaining our artistic standards."

What we are doing now (brief bullets)
- Financial triage and scenario planning to determine runway (48–72 hours).
- Launching a small set of reversible revenue pilots (ticketed pop‑ups, masterclasses, targeted rentals) designed to generate immediate cash within 30 days.
- Prioritizing artist compensation and mission integrity.

The Ask (suggested ladder)
- Option A — One‑time bridge gift
  - $5,000 — helps cover artist fees for a pilot and emergency expenses for one week.
  - $10,000 — covers payroll for one staff member for one month.
  - $25,000 — underwrites a pilot series (3 events + marketing) and guarantees artist payment.
- Option B — Pledge support (3 month bridge)
  - Pledge $X over 3 months to stabilize payroll and operations.
- Option C — Sponsor a pilot / underwriting
  - Underwrite a pilot event for $[amount] — covers artist fees, AV, and marketing; your name credited on program and outreach.

How funds will be used (specific examples)
- Payroll stabilization for [number] staff for [weeks].
- Direct artist fees for [number] performances/classes.
- Underwriting pilot marketing and AV to maximize ticket conversion.

Reassurance & Guardrails
- "We will ensure pilots are reversible, maintain minimum artist compensation, and provide transparent reporting. You will receive a short briefing and results from any pilot you support."

Call to Action
- "Would you be willing to discuss a short‑term gift or underwriting? Lisa Carter (Wild Advice) and our ED [Name] are available for a 15‑minute call. Please contact [email] or [phone]."

Closing
- "With gratitude, [ED Name], Executive Director; Lisa Carter, Wild Advice Partners"

Attachment: Short FAQ (attached/embedded) and a one‑page pilot description if relevant.

Donor FAQ (short)
- Q: Is this permanent? A: No — these are temporary measures to secure payroll and keep programs running while we pursue longer‑term funding.
- Q: How will you report back? A: All donors to this appeal will receive a one‑page update after 30 days with financial reconciliation and pilot outcomes.
- Q: Will artists be paid? A: Yes — artist payment is prioritized in our pilot budgets.

Suggested ask approach:
- Personalize top 10 donors: phone or video call first, follow with email and one‑pager.
- For larger prospective donors: offer a virtual briefing (15–30 minutes) with ED + Lisa + a program artist.

Sample ask amounts (suggested segmentation)
- Anchor donors (top 5): $25k – $100k (depending on historical giving).
- Mid‑level: $5k – $25k.
- Community donors: $250 – $1,000 (via expedited crowdfunding or community drive).

Note: Do not send mass appeals until the Financial Triage Memo is complete and the messaging is approved by ED/Board.

## Financial triage memo — template and example approach

Use this template to structure the 48–72 hour memo. Populate with validated numbers and highlight assumptions.

Memo sections:
1. Executive snapshot (1 page)
   - Current unrestricted cash: $[placeholder]
   - Days of runway (base scenario): [x] days
   - Immediate obligations due within 14 days: payroll $[x], rent $[x], vendor $[x]
   - Highest‑priority recommendation (e.g., secure bridge gift, freeze discretionary spend, run 2 pilots)

2. Cash balance & bank statement evidence
   - Attach/insert screenshots or PDF of bank balance verifications.

3. Scenarios (assumptions must be listed)
   - Base scenario: current burn rate (exclude discretionary spend) → runway formula: Unrestricted cash / monthly net burn × 30 = days runway.
   - Conservative scenario: assumes 10% drop in projected ticket revenue; increased rent or vendor reserve.
   - Optimistic scenario: assumes successful sponsor underwriting + pilot grossing.

Example calculation (illustrative template only — fill with actuals):
- Unrestricted cash = $60,000
- Monthly fixed burn (payroll + rent + fixed) = $45,000
- Monthly variable (program-dependent) = $15,000
- Net monthly burn = $60,000
- Base runway = 60,000 / 60,000 × 30 = 30 days

4. Immediate obligations (next 14 days)
   - Payroll run date: [MM/DD]; total payroll = $[x]
   - Rent due [MM/DD] = $[x]
   - Vendor deposits / grant reporting deliverables = $[x]

5. Recommended immediate actions (ranked)
   - Freeze non‑critical spend (list items).
   - Negotiate with bank/landlord for short deferral.
   - Fast donor outreach to top 10 donors with one‑pager.
   - Launch 1–2 reversible pilots for quick cash (list candidates).
   - Board/ED: convene emergency meeting within 48–72 hours.

6. Sensitivities and contingency paths
   - If runway < 14 days: require immediate donor push + discuss temporary staff reductions (informed by HR/legal).
   - If pilots underperform (less than 50% expected net rev): trigger second donor wave + consider short‑term lines of credit.

7. Appendices
   - Detailed cashflow by day/week for 60 days.
   - List of fixed cost lines with monthly values.
   - Contacts for payroll, bank, landlord.

## Pilot prioritization & P&L template (operational)

When evaluating pilots, use a common P&L template to compare:

Pilot P&L template (columns and example rows):

- Pilot name: [e.g., Curated Ticketed Pop‑Up]
- Date(s): [MM/DD]
- Capacity: [e.g., 80]
- Expected paid attendance: [e.g., 40–60]
- Pricing tiers: General $20 | Supporter $50 | Student $10
- Gross ticket revenue (est): = Sum(tickets sold × price)
- Sponsorship underwriting (if any): $[x]
- Add‑ons revenue (donations, concessions, merch): $[x]
- Marginal costs:
  - Artist fees: $[x]
  - Event staff (per event): $[x]
  - AV incremental: $[x]
  - Marketing (social boost + poster): $[x]
  - Payment fees (var %): $[x]
- Net revenue (Gross + Sponsorship + Add‑ons − Marginal costs) = $[x]
- Cash collection timing: deposit date(s)
- Net contribution to runway within 30 days: $[x]

Illustrative example (fill with real numbers during Day 3–6):
- Capacity 80, expected paid 50 at average $20 = $1,000
- Sponsorship: $2,500 underwriting
- Add‑ons: $200
- Marginal costs: $1,200
- Net revenue = $1,000 + $2,500 + $200 − $1,200 = $2,500

Use the P&L to compare pilots by:
- Speed to cash (days to collect)
- Net revenue margin (%)
- Staff hours required per $ revenue
- Mission fit (qualitative)

---

## Pilot ops pack — checklist (sample SOP for a pop‑up concert)

Pre‑event (T‑7 to T‑1)
- Confirm artist contracts and 50% deposit policies (if applicable).
- Confirm venue configuration and FOH.
- Ticketing: create event in ticketing platform; set up tiers & promo codes.
- Refund policy: clearly published; define handling of comps.
- Marketing: create two email sends + 3 social posts; allocate $100–$300 for boosted posts.
- Staffing: assign event producer, FOH lead, box office, house tech.
- Supplies: print programs (if any), signage, merchandise stock.

Day of event
- Arrival and load in schedule.
- Sound check window & checklists.
- Box office reconciliation & cash handling plan.
- Artist settlement: ensure artist checks/transfer method.
- Collection: ensure all ticketing deposits are processed and tracked.

Post‑event (T+1 to T+3)
- Reconcile gross receipts to bank deposit.
- Fill P&L template and upload to shared folder.
- Send artist satisfaction survey and collect results.
- Quick debrief call (30 minutes) for operational learnings.

## Venue retrofit & low‑cost utilization ideas (Oscar — expanded)

Priority opportunities (low CapEx, fast to implement):
1. Weekend rental packages for community groups & corporate offsites
   - Minimal staffing; rental fee tiers (half‑day, full‑day).
   - Quick marketing to local schools and creative collectives.

2. Curated ticketed pop‑up series
   - Targeted programing for local audiences with pay‑what‑you‑can/paid tiers.

3. Community masterclasses / intensive workshops
   - Small cohorts, higher per‑participant price, with artist revenue share.

4. Streaming + slight paywall
   - Test a pay‑per‑view live stream or voluntary donation model for recorded performances.

5. Co‑working or rehearsal space rentals
   - Daytime idle hours can be monetized for rehearsals and co‑working.

6. Venue micro‑sponsorships
   - Package a season of 3 pop‑ups under a sponsor for naming or comms perks.

Estimated costs & timelines (template):

| Opportunity | Est. Upfront Cost | Time to implement | Staff hours per event | Expected net per event |
|-------------|-------------------:|-------------------:|----------------------:|-----------------------:|
| Weekend rental | $0 – $200 (signage) | 48h | 6–8 | $200–$1,000 |
| Pop‑up concert | $100–$500 | 72h | 12–20 | $500–$3,000 |
| Masterclass | $0–$100 | 4–7 days | 8–12 | $400–$2,000 |
| Streaming setup | $500–1,500 (encoder) | 3–10 days | 6–10 | variable |

Notes:
- Prioritize events that require no major capital and have rapid deposit/collection.
- Ensure any AV investments are reusable across multiple pilots.

## Stakeholder interviews — script & scoring (Marcos)

Purpose: surface artist, staff, and community appetite for pilots; surface constraints and mission sensitivities.

Suggested interview script (15–20 minutes):
1. Quick check‑in: describe the situation and confidentiality (2 min).
2. Ask: What is your immediate capacity to participate in a paid pilot within the next 14 days? (free text + capacity scale 1–5)
3. Ask: Which pilot types would you be most comfortable with? (pop‑up concert / masterclass / streaming / rental) — rank.
4. Ask: What concerns do you have about revenue‑driven pilots? (qualitative)
5. Ask: What minimum artist compensation would you require? (quantify)
6. Ask: Are there scheduling constraints or technical needs we must know? (qualify)
7. Ask: Any suggestions for sponsors or community partners? (free text)
8. Closing: ask permission to share a brief quote in summary and note follow‑up.

Scoring table (for rapid prioritization):
- Capacity to participate (1–5)
- Mission risk sensitivity (1–5; 1 = low risk)
- Likelihood to promote to personal network (1–5)
- Minimum compensation request (USD)
- Total score (sum)

Deliverable: interview summary with anonymized quotes, numeric appetite scoring, and recommended pilots.

## Sample internal staff message (for ED to send ASAP)

Subject: Important update — short note and next steps

Body (recommended phrasing):
- Thank you for all you do. We want to be transparent: a major grant we had expected was withdrawn unexpectedly. We are working with a small team to complete a financial assessment and pursue short‑term revenue pilots to protect payroll and programming.
- Over the next 48–72 hours we will:
  - Complete a financial triage and share an update.
  - Freeze non‑essential spending and hiring.
  - Begin outreach to major donors and sponsors.
- We are prioritizing artist pay and staff jobs. If you have concerns, questions, or ideas, please email [designated inbox] or join a short staff Q&A at [time].
- Final: Express empathy, invite questions, and commit to regular updates.

## Board briefing / escalation (Day 3 and Day 10)

Day 3: Emergency update (30–45 minutes)
- Provide Financial Triage Memo.
- Present immediate recommendations (spend freeze, pilot slate).
- Request emergency authority to contact top donors and execute pilots.

Day 10: Board briefing (60–90 minutes)
- Present pilot outcomes, cash collected, updated runway.
- Request approvals (if needed) for scaling pilots, restructuring, or payroll actions.
- Provide recommended 30/90/180 day plan.

Suggested board slide outline:
1. Executive snapshot (cash, runway).
2. Key actions taken + outcomes to date.
3. Pilot summary and P&L.
4. Updated projection (30/90/180 days).
5. Asks of the board (approvals, introductions, emergency fund).
