    "title": "ZephyrPay \u2014 AML Remediation & Model Audit: 3-week plan",
    "content": "# Executive summary\n\nZephyrPay has received a regulator notice requiring an audited remediation plan for transaction-monitoring (TM), model updates, and client/regulator communications to be delivered within 3 weeks. This document is a pragmatic, staged plan that balances speed with defensible forensic validation and auditability. It provides:\n\n- Immediate 0\u201324 hour asks to buy time and secure inputs.\n- A detailed 72-hour remediation and emergency triage playbook to stabilize monitoring and begin analytics.\n- A comprehensive 3-week delivery plan with explicit owners, milestones, data and access requirements, evidence/acceptance criteria, and a risk/mitigation matrix.\n- Templates and operational artifacts: status memos, regulator cover letters, customer communication scripts, chain-of-custody template, data schema header, suggested SQL/pseudocode for rapid analytics, and auditor selection criteria.\n\nPrimary objectives:\n- Deliver an investor-grade AML remediation plan and audited TM models, together with regulator- and customer-facing communications, within 3 weeks.\n- Provide transparent, defensible evidence and a clear, auditable timeline to satisfy regulator expectations while preserving customer privacy and data protection requirements.\n- Use parallel execution tracks: rapid remediation/instrumentation for immediate regulator engagement and triage, alongside forensic analytics and an independent audit process.\n\nPrepared by: Lisa Carter, Wild Advice Partners  \nLocation: BlueHarbor/ZephyrPay/AML/Deliverables/ZephyrPay_AML_Report_Lisa.md\n\n---\n\n# Scope and objectives (expanded)\n\nPrimary scope\n- Conduct a focused remediation of ZephyrPay\u2019s transaction-monitoring stack and TM model(s) with two deliverables: (a) a defensible remediation package with model validation and evidence suitable for regulator review and (b) an independent auditor\u2019s report that confirms the remediation and provides findings/limitations.\n\nObjectives (measurable)\n1. Produce and submit a regulator-ready remediation package and independent audit report within 21 calendar days.\n2. Stabilize transaction-monitoring to prevent unchecked high-risk flows (technical controls and triage) within 72 hours.\n3. Provide traceable, reproducible forensic analytics demonstrating TM model behavior (false-positive rate, false-negative proxies, high-risk corridors) based on sanitized or enclave-held data.\n4. Preserve privacy and maintain chain-of-custody for all exchanged artifacts.\n5. Produce a customer communications script and regulator communications that are defensible, accurate, and legally reviewed.\n\nOut-of-scope (explicit)\n- Rewriting ZephyrPay\u2019s entire TM platform architecture beyond the 3-week remediation package.\n- Replacing production ML models in the field within the 3-week window (we will propose updates and short-term hardening; implementation to be handed to ZephyrPay for long-term rollout).\n- Accessing unapproved sensitive PII without clear legal/contractual guardrails (we will rely on pseudonymised sample, secure enclave, or synthetic data).\n\nSuccess criteria\n- Regulator acknowledges receipt and sufficiency of remediation package and grants an initial compliance timeline.\n- Independent auditor issues an audit report (with findings and limitations) that supports the remediation plan.\n- Evidence shows measurable improvements in alert triage (e.g., fewer critical missed flows in prioritized corridors and documented controls applied).\n- Chain-of-custody and documentation satisfy internal legal and regulator expectations.\n\n---\n\n# Immediate (0\u201324h) actions \u2014 purpose: buy time and secure basic inputs\n\nPrimary objective for 0\u201324h: show regulator we are engaged, request access to the minimal defensible data/sample, secure communication channels, and position teams to start the 72h playbook.\n\nOwners in parentheses below indicate the actionable owner(s) for each ask.\n\nAction list (0\u201324h)\n\n1. Upload and submit a 1-page regulator-ready status memo showing we are engaged and have a clear plan (Lisa).\n   - Deliverable path: BlueHarbor/ZephyrPay/AML/Deliverables/Status_Memo_Lisa.md\n   - Acceptance: Memo uploaded, regulator confirmation of receipt (email or portal acknowledgment).\n\n2. Obtain ZephyrPay point-of-contact (POC) and legal counsel contact, and request the original regulator notice/checklist (Client/MC).\n   - Owner: Client / MC\n   - Acceptance: Named POC + legal counsel email/phone and copy of original notice.\n\n3. Confirm shared secure folder and transfer method (Marcos / Oscar).\n   - Action: Create destination folder on agreed secure platform, set ACLs, and confirm transfer method (SFTP, secure cloud share, or secure enclave).\n   - Acceptance: Folder URL, permitted user list, and transfer protocol documented.\n\n4. Request a <=1000-row pseudonymised sample extract matching exact schema (Alex).\n   - If client-side hashing and transfer not possible, request secure enclave access or a synthetic dataset preserving joint distributions.\n   - Acceptance: Sample delivered to secure folder or evidence of secure enclave session scheduled.\n\n5. Legal to standby to review all regulator wording and the customer communication script (Legal).\n   - Action: Legal to confirm preferred wording constraints and any regulator-specific phrasing to avoid admission liability.\n   - Acceptance: Legal confirms when available, and provides redlines within 4 hours of draft.\n\n6. Stand up a 09:00 daily stand-up calendar invite for regulator POC and ZephyrPay leadership with list of attendees and expected cadence (Lisa).\n   - Acceptance: Calendar invite accepted by POC and ZephyrPay leadership.\n\nDeliverable: Status memo uploaded to BlueHarbor/ZephyrPay/AML/Deliverables/Status_Memo_Lisa.md (Lisa, deadline: 24h)\n\nSample 24h status memo (template to paste directly)\n- Brief greeting and summary of receipt of notice.\n- Statement of engagement and named Wild Advice Partners lead.\n- High-level plan and timeline (72h triage + 3-week remediation).\n- Ask list and deadlines (sample, secure folder, POCs).\n- Request for regulator POC for daily updates and confirmation of preferred delivery format.\n\n(Full templated memo included in Appendix.)\n\n---\n\n# 72h remediation & emergency triage playbook (deliverable by end of day 3)\n\nOverview\nWithin 72 hours we must (a) implement short-term technical controls to prevent material risk, (b) begin prioritized analytics on the pseudonymised sample to quantify initial scope, (c) prepare regulator-facing interim documentation, and (d) shortlist auditors for independent review.

No action required from customers unless they receive direct correspondence. If customers have concerns, route to the CX escalation team contact. Full script with legal-approved wording is included in Appendix.\n\n---\n\n# Forensic analytics & model validation approach (technical)\n\nThis section outlines the forensic analytics and model validation methodology to create defensible evidence for the regulator and the auditor.\n\nObjectives\n- Quantify model behavior with respect to false positives and false negatives (proxy approaches where ground truth is limited).\n- Demonstrate model stability across time, corridors, and customer segments.\n- Show impact of proposed short-term controls.\n\nData preparation & QC\n- Validate schema and row counts.\n- Time-window normalization: convert timestamps to UTC and apply consistent rolling windows.\n- Null/missing value handling: document imputation rules; avoid imputing key identifiers.\n- Reproducibility: all scripts saved, notebooks versioned, and outputs hashed.\n\nCore analytics & tests\n1. Basic metrics\n   - Alert rate overall and by day/hour.\n   - Disposition rates by model_version and payment_method.\n2. Confusion proxies\n   - Where hand-labeled dispositions exist, compute precision, recall, F1.\n   - If full ground truth not available, use tiered proxy metrics: e.g., confirmed_disposition_rate among flagged flows as proxy for precision.\n3. Calibration analysis\n   - Calibration curve: expected vs observed positive rate by score bucket.\n   - Reliability diagrams and Brier score where appropriate.\n4. Sensitivity analysis\n   - Threshold sweep: compute trade-off between alert volume and confirmed positives for model_score thresholds.\n   - Perturbation testing: small changes to features to measure score sensitivity.\n5. Temporal/backtest analysis\n   - Backtest on historical windows: how would model_version X have performed over prior months?\n6. Corridor analysis\n   - Identify top sender\u2192receiver corridors with high confirmed suspicious activity and measure model performance there.\n7. Model drift detection\n   - Statistical tests for feature distribution shifts between training period and recent data (KS-test, PSI).\n8.
