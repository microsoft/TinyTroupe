    "title": "MultiLever \u2014 Rapid Diagnostic & Action Plan (Inflation & Demand Shock)",
    "content": "# Executive summary\n\nMultiLever experienced approximately 10% input-price inflation and an approximately 20% decline in consumer demand in the most recent quarter. The demand decline is concentrated in three categories: food, home appliances, and toys. This document proposes a prioritized, time\u2011boxed engagement to rapidly diagnose the drivers, quantify impacts under plausible scenarios, and deliver short\u2011to\u2011 and medium\u2011term actions that protect revenue while maintaining margin integrity.\n\nKey short\u2011term objective: deliver a rapid diagnostic within 5 business days to identify the top 2\u20133 demand drivers per category and recommend immediate mitigations that can be tested or deployed within 2\u20134 weeks.\n\nSummary of recommendations (high level)\n- Run a 5\u2011business\u2011day rapid diagnostic to produce a one\u2011page executive finding and a data appendix with preliminary elasticity estimates and top drivers by SKU/segment/channel.\n- Follow with 2\u20133 weeks of scenario modelling using hierarchical/segment\u2011level elasticity models, promotion and pack\u2011size simulations, and margin tradeoff analysis.\n- Deliver a week\u20114 prioritized playbook with pilot designs, owners, KPIs, and quantified ROI to guide 2\u20134 week pilots and subsequent scaling.\n\nThis plan balances speed and robustness: early work focuses on high\u2011signal aggregates and quick wins; modelling then refines results for strategic pilots and scale.\n\n---\n\n# Situation & key facts (expanded)\n\nObserved metrics (company\u2011reported)\n- Input cost increase: ~ +10% YoY on weighted average COGS across SKUs (documented by Procurement and Finance).\n- Demand change: ~ \u221220% in aggregate sales revenue for the quarter vs the previous comparable quarter (seasonally adjusted), concentrated in three categories:\n  - Food: \u221222% revenue; unit sales down \u221218%.\n  - Home appliances: \u221225% revenue; unit sales down \u221223%.\n  - Toys: \u221218% revenue; unit sales down \u221220%.\n- Geographic concentration: greatest declines in Region East and Region South (retail partner channels), comparatively smaller declines in Direct Online channels but lower traffic.\n\nOperational constraints and client context\n- R&D capacity exists but is limited: core R&D team can reallocate 20\u201330% capacity to rapid feasibility studies; large reformulations will require longer timelines.\n- Commercial/Analytics has access to transactional data but recent BI snapshots are incomplete for promotions and returns.\n- Time pressure: client needs implementable options within 2\u20134 weeks for peak trading windows and to preserve FY targets.\n- Regulatory or procurement constraints (to be confirmed) may limit maximum allowable discounts or bill\u2011of\u2011materials changes for certain SKUs (notably food).\n\nCategory snapshots (initial observations)\n- Food: high frequency purchase, relatively low unit price; high sensitivity to price increases and smaller pack options historically perform well in price\u2011sensitive cohorts.\n- Home appliances: higher\u2011ticket items, longer purchase cycles; demand appears sensitive to financing terms and promotional bundles rather than unit price alone.\n- Toys: seasonal and gift\u2011driven; demand drop correlates with decreased promotional activity and fewer product launches.\n\n---\n\n# Core diagnostic questions (expanded and operationalized)\n\n1. What share of the observed demand decline is explained by:\n   - Pure price elasticity (pass\u2011through of input inflation to consumer prices)?\n   - Income effects / macro consumer pressure (household income declines or sentiment)?\n   - Channel shifts (customers moving from one channel to another, causing lower conversion or measurement issues)?\n   - Competitor actions (aggressive pricing, bundle offers, new SKUs)?\n   - Other factors (supply out\u2011of\u2011stocks, negative product sentiment, seasonality variance)?\n   For each, produce approximate contribution estimates (e.g., % of total demand decline attributable).\n\n2. Which SKUs, segments, channels, or cohorts are most sensitive (high elasticity) and which are resilient?\n   - Produce an ordered SKU list per category by estimated price elasticity, margin contribution, and strategic importance.\n   - Highlight SKUs that are \u201cmargin protectors\u201d (low elasticity, high margin), candidate \u201cvolume drivers\u201d (high elasticity, high share), and \u201cstrategic losses\u201d (high elasticity, low margin \u2014 avoid heavy discounts).\n\n3. What low\u2011effort, high\u2011impact levers are immediately available to test and implement within 2\u20134 weeks?\n   - Rank levers by expected impact (demand lift), cost (margin erosion or implementation cost), time\u2011to\u2011implement, and risk.\n\n4. What pilot designs and KPIs will give rapid, statistically meaningful results for the most promising levers?\n\n5. Under plausible competitor reaction scenarios, what guardrails should the business apply to discounting or pack changes to protect long\u2011term margin?\n\n---\n\n# Recommended engagement structure & timeline (detailed)\n\nOverall timeline: 4 weeks (time\u2011boxed phases), with clear deliverables and owners.\n\nPhase 1 \u2014 Rapid diagnostic (5 business days)\n- Deliverable: 1\u2011page diagnostic summary + data appendix (CSV & visuals).\n- Objectives:\n  - Identify top 2\u20133 demand drivers per impacted category (food, appliances, toys).\n  - Estimate preliminary price elasticities at SKU or segment level using log\u2011linear regressions and simple fixed effects where possible.\n  - Flag quick wins: 3\u20136 interventions per category that could be piloted within 2\u20134 weeks.\n- Activities (day\u2011by\u2011day):\n  - Day 0 (kickoff): confirm data access, nominate client analytics/R&D contacts, finalize scope and out\u2011of\u2011scope SKUs.\n  - Day 1: ingest sales, pricing, promo calendar, COGS, and channel data; run data quality checks (missingness, out\u2011liers).\n  - Day 2: descriptive analytics \u2014 time series of revenue, units, price, promos by SKU/channel/region; identify large discontinuities and OOS events.\n  - Day 3: preliminary elasticity estimates (log(price) -> log(quantity) with SKU or category fixed effects), promo lift estimates, and quick segmentation by cohort (loyal vs trial).\n  - Day 4: synthesize findings, draft the one\u2011page executive diagnostic, prepare data appendix and reproducible code.\n  - Day 5: review with client, hand off detailed appendix.\n- Team & roles:\n  - Owner: Lisa (lead analyst & author).\n  - Support: Alex (data ingestion, ETL, QA).\n  - Client lead: named contact in Commercial/Analytics (TBD).\n- Outputs:\n  - One\u2011page diagnostic (top 3 drivers per category + confidence levels).\n  - Data appendix: CSV of cleaned aggregated series (SKU x week x channel), model code snippets, and initial elasticity priors.\n\nPhase 2 \u2014 Modelling & scenarios (2\u20133 weeks)\n- Deliverable: scenario deck with quantified outcomes and recommended interventions.\n- Objectives:\n  - Build more refined elasticity models (hierarchical Bayesian or mixed effects models) to estimate elasticity by SKU, channel, and cohort.\n  - Simulate interventions: pricing changes, pack size introductions, targeted promotions, and loyalty offers.\n  - Margins: run COGS and cost\u2011to\u2011serve scenarios to show profit/revenue tradeoffs.\n- Activities:\n  - Expand feature set (promotional mechanics, pack sizes, competitor price series, marketing exposures).\n  - Build hierarchical models that pool information across SKUs within a category to improve estimates for low\u2011volume SKUs.\n  - Run scenario simulations for 3 business cases (Base, Recession\u2011deep, Competitor price war).\n  - Feasibility check with R&D for product variant options (list of candidate SKUs with estimated COGS delta and expected timeline).\n- Team & roles:\n  - Owner: Lisa (modelling & scenario lead).\n  - Support: Alex (feature engineering & validation), Client R&D (feasibility inputs), Sara (engagement sponsor/PM).\n- Outputs:\n  - Scenario deck with tables showing revenue, margin, and ROI under candidate tactics and competitor responses.\n  - Ranked list of pilot candidates with estimated demand uplift, margin change, and time\u2011to\u2011implement.\n\nPhase 3 \u2014 Recommendations & implementation plan (week 4)\n- Deliverable: prioritized playbook + quantified ROI and owners for pilot/scale.\n- Objectives:\n  - Prioritize tactics by expected demand lift / margin impact / time\u2011to\u2011implement.\n  - Provide pilot designs with statistical power calculations, KPIs, monitoring dashboards, and escalation rules.\n  - Communication templates for internal stakeholders and retail partners.\n- Activities:\n  - Finalize prioritization using agreed decision criteria.\n  - Produce playbooks and estimated budgets/owners for each pilot.\n  - Schedule rolling implementation plans and performance review cadence.\n- Team & roles:\n  - Owner: Lisa (report author).\n  - Partner: Sara (client engagement & approvals).\n  - Client Ops/Retail: implementation owners for pilots.\n- Outputs:\n  - Implementation playbook with owners, timelines, and KPIs.\n  - Monitoring dashboard templates and reporting cadence for pilot governance.\n\nHigh\u2011level timeline (condensed)\nWeek 0: Kickoff and data access (0\u201348 hours)\nWeek 1 (days 1\u20135): Rapid diagnostic deliverable\nWeek 2\u20133: Scenario modelling and R&D feasibility\nWeek 4: Recommendations, playbook, and pilot readiness\n\n---\n\n# Tactical levers to evaluate (expanded, with deployment notes)\n\nFor each lever we provide: short description, deployment time estimate, implementation complexity, expected impact direction, and sample KPIs.\n\n1. Pricing & pack-sizing\n- Description: Introduce lower\u2011priced formats (smaller SKUs), multi\u2011packs, and psychological price points. Consider tiered price anchoring and value SKUs.\n- Time to pilot: 2\u20134 weeks for pack\u2011size promos through retail partners (if shelf space not required); 4\u20138 weeks for permanent pack SKU launches.\n- Complexity: medium (packaging, SKU codes, distribution updates).\n- Expected impact: increases purchase incidence in price\u2011sensitive cohorts; potential margin compression depending on COGS.\n- KPIs: unit sales change, revenue per household, margin per unit, frequency of purchase, uplift vs control stores.\n\n2. Targeted promotions\n- Description: Redirect promotional spend to cohorts with highest expected ROI \u2014 loyal customers, price\u2011sensitive segments, or high LTV prospects.\n- Time to pilot: 1\u20132 weeks to set up targeted digital promos; 2\u20134 weeks for retailer coupon arrangements.\n- Complexity: low to medium (depends on segmentation availability).\n- Expected impact: higher conversion and more efficient promo spend.\n- KPIs: promo redemption rate, incremental units, promo ROI (incremental margin / promo cost).\n\n3. Cost\u2011to\u2011serve & supply chain\n- Description: Quick wins by optimizing distribution (e.g., consolidation of pick batches, alternate fulfillment nodes) to reduce cost\u2011to\u2011serve and free margin for targeted discounts.\n- Time to pilot: 1\u20133 weeks to change fulfillment routes or packing rules.\n- Complexity: medium (operations coordination).\n- Expected impact: margin protection enabling selective discounts without net margin loss.\n- KPIs: cost\u2011to\u2011serve per order, fulfillment lead time, stock\u2011out rate.\n\n4. Product reformulation / lower\u2011cost variants\n- Description: Use R&D to identify substitutions or simplifications that keep perceived quality but reduce ingredient or BOM costs.\n- Time to pilot: 4\u201312 weeks for rapid feasibility and small\u2011batch trials; longer for regulatory approvals if needed.\n- Complexity: high (R&D, regulatory, procurement).\n- Expected impact: permanent margin improvement if accepted by customers.\n- KPIs: COGS reduction per unit, sensory acceptance score, pilot sell\u2011through.\n\n5. Loyalty & subscriptions\n- Description: Pilot subscription programs, auto\u2011replenishment discounts, and bundled value packs to stabilize demand among high\u2011LTV customers.\n- Time to pilot: 2\u20136 weeks depending on platform readiness.\n- Complexity: medium (CRM, billing).\n- Expected impact: demand smoothing and retention uplift.\n- KPIs: churn rate, ARPU, lifetime value change.\n\n6.

Increase share in direct channels if margins allow and acquisition costs are favorable.\n- Time to pilot: 1\u20133 weeks for tactical shifts.\n- Complexity: low to medium.\n- KPIs: CAC, conversion rate, gross margin contribution per channel.\n\nEach lever will be quantified in the modelling phase (Phase 2) with expected demand lift and margin impact under multiple scenarios.\n\n---\n\n# Data needs (expanded and precise schema)\n\nTo run the diagnostic quickly we require the following, ideally in the specified formats. For each item we indicate minimum acceptable quality, preferred file format, and example headers.\n\n1. SKU\u2011level sales and units by day/week for the last 12 months (including returns)\n- Minimum: weekly aggregation per SKU for 12 months, with units, revenue, returns.\n- Preferred: transactional (order line) CSV with headers:\n  - order_id, order_date, sku, units, gross_price, net_price, channel, customer_id (nullable), region, return_flag, promo_code\n- Note: include timezone and calendar conventions.\n\n2. SKU listed price, promotional price, promotion calendar and promo mechanics\n- Preferred: promo_calendar.csv\n  - sku, promo_start_date, promo_end_date, promo_type (discount, BOGO, coupon), promo_mechanics (e.g., 20% off, 2 for 1), trade_spend_allocated\n- Include effective displayed price per promo day if possible.\n\n3. Channel & region breakdowns (online, retail partner, direct), including traffic and conversion where available\n- Preferred: channel_metrics.csv\n  - date, channel, sku (optional), sessions (if digital), clicks, adds_to_cart, checkouts, orders, units, revenue, conversion_rate\n- If partner data is limited, provide aggregated weekly KPIs by channel.\n\n4. Cost and margin at SKU level (COGS, cost-to-serve)\n- Preferred: sku_costs.csv\n  - sku, cogs_per_unit, packaging_cost, freight_alloc_per_unit, cost_to_serve_per_unit, current_list_price, net_margin\n- If only BOM available, provide BOM and master cost assumptions.\n\n5. Loyalty / customer\u2011level panels or cohort metrics if available\n- Preferred: customer_purchases.csv (delivered as hashed IDs)\n  - customer_id, order_id, order_date, sku, units, price, channel, cohort_tag (if available)\n- Also include segment definitions or churn flags.\n\n6. Competitor price data (if available) or top\u20115 competitor pricing snapshots\n- Preferred: competitor_prices.csv\n  - sku_or_competitor_sku, competitor, date, listed_price, promo_flag, source\n- If not available, note data collection constraints and whether scraping or syndicated data purchase is possible.\n\n7. Consumer or macro data on household income or consumer sentiment\n- Examples: regional unemployment, disposable income indices, consumer confidence indices aligned to the last 12 months.\n\n8. R&D inputs: bill\u2011of\u2011materials at SKU level, current formulation specs, and a named R&D contact\n- Preferred: bom_sku.xlsx and formulation_specs.pdf\n  - bom_sku: sku, ingredient_code, ingredient_name, qty_per_unit, unit_cost, supplier, lead_time\n- Provide contact name, email, and best times for rapid calls.\n\nData access: provide an API key, BI account, SFTP link, or shared folder (e.g., secure S3 bucket). If credentials cannot be shared, plan a 1\u2011hour screen share to run queries with client analysts.\n\n---\n\n# Rapid diagnostic: technical approach (concrete)\n\nAnalytical methods to be used in the 5\u2011day diagnostic (keep computations simple and reproducible)\n\n1. Descriptive analytics\n- Time series decomposition at weekly granularity: baseline trend, seasonality, and noise.\n- SKU concentration analysis: Pareto (top 20% SKUs by revenue), volatility index (coefficient of variation of weekly units).\n- Channel conversion funnel analysis using available digital metrics.\n\n2. Preliminary price elasticity estimation\n- Model: log(quantity_t) = alpha + beta * log(price_t) + gamma * promo_t + SKU_FE + region_FE + epsilon_t\n  - Interpret beta as elasticity. For aggregated data, run per category and pooled SKU models.\n- Where price endogeneity is a concern (e.g., price changed in response to demand), use instrumental variables if a valid instrument is available (e.g., cost shock, supplier price index) \u2014 flagged as low confidence in rapid diagnostic.\n- Output: elasticity point estimates with standard errors and an elasticity prior table for modelling phase.\n\n3. Promo lift estimation\n- Estimate immediate incremental units attributable to promotions using regression with promo dummies and lag terms to capture post\u2011promo effects.\n\n4. Quick segmentation\n- Segment customers into high\u2011LTV and price\u2011sensitive cohorts if customer data exists. If not, use proxy (repeat purchase rate, average basket value).\n\n5. Out\u2011of\u2011stock detection\n- Using sales velocity and inventory data (if available) to flag potential OOS confounders.\n\nDeliverables from Phase 1 include the code notebook (R/Python), key SQL queries, and clean aggregated CSVs.\n\nExample quick SQL extraction (pseudo)\n- Sales by SKU/week:\n  SELECT sku, DATE_TRUNC('week', order_date) AS week, SUM(units) as units, SUM(net_price * units) as revenue\n  FROM orders\n  WHERE order_date >= DATEADD(month, -12, CURRENT_DATE)\n  GROUP BY sku, week\n  ORDER BY sku, week;\n\n---\n\n# Scenario modelling (Phase 2) \u2014 sample scenarios and assumptions\n\nWe recommend modelling at least three scenarios to bound outcomes and stress test recommendations.\n\nScenario definitions (example)\n- Scenario A: Base case \u2014 assume current competitor pricing stable, household income continues at recent levels. Model elasticities as estimated in Phase 1.\n- Scenario B: Downside macro \u2014 further 3\u20135% drop in disposable income; forecasted demand contraction baseline \u221210% relative to Base.\n- Scenario C: Competitor price war \u2014 competitors reduce prices by 8\u201312% in key SKUs; assume partial pass\u2011through and estimate share loss.\n\nSample tactic simulations (illustrative; values to be replaced with model outputs)\n- Tactic 1: Introduce 20% smaller pack priced at \u221212% price per unit\n  - Expected: +8\u201312% units among price\u2011sensitive cohort, net margin per unit change \u22123% (due to packaging cost).\n- Tactic 2: Targeted 10% off for loyalty segment (digital coupon)\n  - Expected: +10\u201315% incremental purchase rate in the targeted cohort; incremental promo cost vs incremental margin to be evaluated.\n- Tactic 3: Cost\u2011to\u2011serve reduction of $0.50 per order via fulfillment optimization\n  - Expected: margin improvement directly additive to pilot economics; allows for limited targeted discounting without net margin loss.\n\nSample scenario table (format)\n\n| Scenario | Assumption | Revenue impact (12 weeks) | Margin impact | Confidence |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---|\n| Base | No competitor reaction; elasticities per Phase 1 | \u221210% | \u22126% points | Medium |\n| Downside | \u22125% disposable income | \u221218% | \u22129% points | Low |\n| Price war | Competitors \u221210% price | \u221222% (market share loss) | \u221212% | Low |\n\nNote: These are illustrative. Phase 2 will produce precise scenario tables per SKU and category.\n\n---\n\n# Pilot design & statistical considerations\n\nFor each prioritized tactic we provide a template pilot design with sample sizes and expected detection windows.\n\nA/B test design (example)\n- Objective: measure the incremental uplift in weekly units from a 10% targeted discount to loyalty customers.\n- Population: loyalty cohort (n = 50,000 customers).\n- Randomization: at customer level.\n- Treatment: 10% digital coupon valid for 2 weeks.\n- Control: no coupon.\n- Outcome metric: weekly units per customer (primary), conversion rate (secondary).\n- Power calculation (example):\n  - Baseline weekly purchase rate = 1.2% for cohort.\n  - Want to detect a 20% relative uplift (to 1.44%).\n  - Required sample per arm \u2248 20,000 customers (assume alpha=0.05, power=0.8).\n- KPI dashboard elements: cumulative lift, cumulative incremental units, ROI, redemption by channel.\n\nRetail partner pilot (example)\n- Objective: measure SKU sell\u2011through lift from introducing a new 20% smaller pack at price P.\n- Design: 20 matched stores (10 treatment, 10 control), matched by historical sales and footfall.\n- Duration: 6 weeks (includes 2\u2011week run\u2011in and 4\u2011week measurement).\n- Outcome: units per store per week, sell\u2011through %, margin per store.\n- Statistical notes: use difference\u2011in\u2011differences with store fixed effects controlling for seasonality.\n\nMonitoring & governance\n- Daily monitoring for OOS and supply constraints.\n- Weekly steering calls with named owners; immediate pause rules for margin erosion beyond agreed guardrails.\n\n---\n\n# Deliverables & owners (expanded)\n\nExplicit deliverables, owners, and timelines.

Risk: Slow R&D feasibility approvals\n- Likelihood: Medium.\n- Impact: Medium\u2013High for reformulation tactics.\n- Mitigation:\n  - Include fallback tactics that do not require R&D (pack sizing, promotions, channel shifts).\n  - Ask R&D to commit to initial handwritten feasibility notes within 72 hours.\n\n3. Risk: Price wars / competitor responses\n- Likelihood: Medium.\n- Impact: High (could drive margin erosion).\n- Mitigation:\n  - Model competitor reaction scenarios and build guardrails (e.g., maximum aggregate discounting exposure, duration limits).\n  - Prioritize tactics less likely to trigger price war (targeted coupons, loyalty bundles).\n\n4. Risk: Operational constraints for pilots (shelf space, packaging lead time)\n- Likelihood: Medium.\n- Impact: Medium.\n- Mitigation:\n  - Engage Ops/Procurement early and prioritize pilots that require minimal packaging changes (promos, shelf displays, digital bundling).\n  - Use digital channels and direct fulfillment to test concepts.\n\n5. Risk: Statistical insignificance due to small samples or short pilot windows\n- Likelihood: Medium.\n- Impact: Medium.\n- Mitigation:\n  - Conduct power calculations before pilot launch and adjust sample sizes or durations.\n  - Use matched store tests and hierarchical pooling to increase power.\n\nRisk matrix (summary table)\n\n| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Primary mitigation |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Data delays/quality | High | High | Prioritized MVSD; data runbook |\n| Slow R&D approvals | Medium | Medium | Fallback tactics; R&D 72h commitment |\n| Competitor price war | Medium | High | Scenario modelling; discount guardrails |\n| Operational pilot constraints | Medium | Medium | Early Ops alignment; digital pilots |\n| Insufficient power | Medium | Medium | Power calc & hierarchical pooling |\n\n---\n\n# Success metrics & pilot KPIs (expanded)\n\nPrimary success metric (pilot)\n- Change in weekly sales volume and revenue vs baseline for pilot SKUs (measured as incremental lift and expressed in absolute units and percentage).\n\nSecondary metrics\n- Margin impact: change in contribution margin and gross margin percentage for pilot SKUs.\n- Promo ROI: incremental gross profit attributable to promo divided by promotional spend.\n- Conversion lift by channel: percentage improvement in conversion post\u2011intervention for online channels.\n- Retention: change in repeat purchase rate for loyalty/subscription pilots.\n- Cost metrics: change in cost\u2011to\u2011serve or fulfillment cost per order.\n\nSuggested KPI dashboard structure\n- Top row: campaign status, start/end dates, pilot lead, decision date.\n- Time series charts: weekly units vs baseline, revenue, margin.\n- Table: SKU / store / cohort level summary with columns: baseline units/week, treatment units/week, incremental units, incremental revenue, incremental gross margin, ROI.\n- Alerts: OOS rate > 5%, margin erosion beyond pre\u2011approved threshold, competitor price change > 5%.\n\nDecision criteria for scaling\n- Positive incremental units and positive incremental margin (or acceptable margin erosion within guardrails) for at least 4 consecutive weeks AND statistical significance per pre\u2011agreed alpha level OR clear commercial justification.\n\n---\n\n# Implementation plan & resource estimate (week\u2011by\u2011week)\n\nSample resource allocation and estimated time required for core activities.
