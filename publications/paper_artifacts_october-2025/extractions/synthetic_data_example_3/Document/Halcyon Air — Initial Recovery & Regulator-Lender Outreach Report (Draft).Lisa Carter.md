# Executive Summary
Halcyon Air is experiencing cascading operational disruption driven by three simultaneous stressors: a cluster of pilot sickness cases reducing crew availability, two aircraft on ground (AOG) awaiting parts/MRO work, and tightening lender covenants that constrain cash flexibility. Compounding these issues are market-specific FX constraints that limit our ability to make short-notice wet-lease payments in some countries.

Immediate objective: restore and maintain a minimum safe scheduled service across revenue-critical routes within 10 days while stabilizing liquidity and preserving regulator and lessor confidence. This document sets out: an expanded diagnosis, prioritized immediate actions for 0–10 days, medium-term stabilizers for 10–30 days, detailed governance with named owners and deadlines, concrete data requirements and templates, sample communications (regulator/lender/passengers/staff), decision matrices (wet-lease scoring, crew triage), a cash/covenant scenario analysis, detailed risk register and mitigations, and appendices with checklists and upload templates to enable rapid execution.

Key measurable goals (next 72 hours)
- Upload and validate critical diagnostic data (fleet sheet, crew roster, active schedule) — T+1 hour.
- Convene ops war-room and agree minimum-service 10-day schedule — T+60–90 minutes.
- Provide regulator pre-call brief and make initial outreach — T+2–3 hours.
- Produce a shortlist of up to five wet-lease providers with full terms — T+12 hours.
- Deliver initial cash/covenant scenarios to lenders and internal stakeholders — T+4 hours.

---

## Immediate situation (as of this draft — snapshot)
- Two AOG aircraft (tail numbers: placeholder entries until Oscar uploads full details). Current action: MRO notified; diagnostic reports in progress. ETA for parts and return-to-service pending parts manifest and MRO labor queue.
- Significant crew unavailability: multiple pilots/crew reporting sickness across hubs. Extent unknown — crew roster and last-flight/currency details required immediately to model reserve capacity and compliance with flight/duty time regulations.
- Tight lender covenants: several covenant thresholds are close to trigger windows, particularly liquidity and consolidated leverage covenants. Wet-lease expense could materially increase near-term cash outflow.
- FX/payment constraints: in at least two operating markets, local banking restrictions delay same-day cross-border transfers; some wet-lease providers insist on USD/EUR payments.

Current known assumptions (to be validated)
- Traffic demand for core routes remains at ~70–85% of seasonal baseline.
- Passengers are likely to seek alternatives if cancellations exceed 6–12 hours without proactive communication/compensation.
- No safety incidents have occurred; priority remains safety-first.

---

## Recommended short-term tactics (0–10 days) — detailed playbook

A. Safety-first regulator engagement (Owner: Lisa)
   - Objective: Keep the regulator fully informed; obtain specific, time-boxed flexibility only where strictly necessary; avoid requests that would undermine safety oversight.
   - Pre-call deliverables:
     - One-page summary (situation, immediate actions, 10-day remediation plan, ask).
     - Regulator call script and FAQ (Appendix contains script and anticipated Q&A).
   - Recommended asks (narrow and specific, examples):
     - Short-term conditional relief on slot return deadlines for affected flights while RFS committed.
     - Agreement on acceptable substitution aircraft types on certain routes pending passenger notification and safety compliance.
     - Confirmation on any additional oversight requirements for wet-leased aircraft (e.g., need for specific validations or additional crew checks).
   - During call:
     - Keep Halcyon ops lead on the line; have MRO and safety officer available to answer technical questions.
     - Log the call with time stamp, attendees, commitments, and next steps.
   - Post-call:
     - Upload regulator confirmation/notes and any formal approvals to Halcyon folder.
     - Share one-page update to lenders and internal execs.

B. War-room + triage (Owner: Marcos/Oscar; facilitation: Lisa)
   - Purpose: Rapid decision-making on which flights to operate, wet-lease, or suspend; allocate staff; and assign communications.
   - Suggested war-room agenda (30–90 minutes):
     - 0–5 min: Opening, objectives, attendees and roles.
     - 5–20 min: Core data review — fleet sheet, crew roster, priority routes.
     - 20–40 min: Cash & covenant senior summary and wet-lease options.
     - 40–60 min: Decisions on minimum-service schedule (10-day window): list flights to run and method (internal/wet-lease/suspend).
     - 60–75 min: Communications plan assignment: regulator, lenders, customers, staff, lessors.
     - 75–90 min: Execution checklist and next steps; confirm decision log entries and responsible owners.
   - Outputs:
     - Signed decision memo with time-stamped approvals.
     - Task assignments in project tracker with deadlines.

C. Wet-lease procurement & FX mitigation (Owner: Sara)
   - Procurement approach:
     - Pre-qualify providers that can deploy within 24–72 hours.
     - Favor providers that accept local currency or staged payments (down payment + daily true-up) to reduce FX stress.
     - Include termination provisions and daily/hourly caps to cap downside.
     - Shorten procurement cycle by using standard Halcyon Master Wet-Lease Appendix (legal to prepare quick-sign addendum).
   - Wet-lease scoring matrix (sample weights):
     - Availability (30%), Price (25%), Currency/payment flexibility (15%), Ferry time (10%), Regulatory readiness (10%), Crew included (10%).
     - Use attached template to rank providers and justify selection.

D. Cash & covenant management (Owner: Alex with Lisa)
   - Scenario modelling:
     - Scenario A — Internal triage only: costs limited to crew adjustments and minor third-party spend. Projected 10-day burn = baseline + X.
     - Scenario B — Wet-lease assisted: includes top 2 wet-lease options for high-priority routes; 10–30 day cash impact modeled.
     - Scenario C — Pessimistic: both AOGs out for extended period, high wet-lease exposure and elevated passenger compensation.
   - Lender communications:
     - Prepare a concise one-page lender summary (see Appendix sample) showing current liquidity, the mitigation plan, and an ask (e.g., covenant waiver or forbearance for a defined period).
     - Provide supporting Excel workbook with cash flows and covenant calculation mechanics for lender review.
   - Negotiation posture:
     - Keep requests time-bound and backed by operational milestones (e.g., “If we can re-introduce 70% of Tier 1 routes within 10 days, covenant relief no longer required.”).

---

## Medium-term stabilizers (10–30 days) — prioritized interventions
- Repair & return of AOG aircraft (Owner: Oscar)
  - Coordinate 24/7 with MROs; request prioritized work packs; consider two-shift coverage to compress RFS where economically justified.
  - Consider sourcing parts from alternate vendors or cannibalizing a grounded non-revenue aircraft if contractual/lessor approvals permit (legal/lessor advice required).

- Rebalance network and frequency (Owner: Alex + Halcyon network team)
  - Re-assess demand patterns; cut low-yield frequencies temporarily; consolidate flows to protect aircraft utilization and margins.
  - Implement conditional schedule changes with partner carriers and adjust code-share commitments.

- Cost-to-serve savings and temporary revenue tactics (Owner: Halcyon finance + Lisa)
  - Immediate discretionary spend freeze (capex paused, vendor non-essential payments deferred where possible).
  - Temporary product/pricing adjustments (lower add-on allowances or change fees for rebooking) designed to preserve cash short-term while minimizing passenger disruption.

- Crew recency & hiring (Owner: Crew Manager + HR)
  - Initiate targeted short-term contract pilot hiring in markets with supply; assess use of training centers for accelerated recency refresh where safe and regulator-permitted.

- Contract and legal reviews (Owner: Legal)
  - Review wet-lease agreements, lessor covenants, and existing insurance coverage for war-risk, contingencies, and third-party liabilities.

## Key risks & mitigations — expanded risk register
Below is an actionable risk register with likelihood, impact, priority and mitigation owners.

| Risk | Likelihood (L/M/H) | Impact (L/M/H) | Priority | Mitigation | Owner |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|---|
| Wet-lease unavailable or prohibitively expensive | H | H | 1 | Prioritise Tier 1 routes, negotiate staged payments, target regional providers, use charters as fallback, escalate to lenders for quick bridge funding | Sara / Alex |
| Regulator escalates enforcement (reputational/legal) | M | H | 2 | Proactive outreach, provide safety-focused mitigation, keep open lines with regulator, document all measures | Lisa / Halcyon ops lead |
| Covenant breach due to cash burn | M | H | 3 | Early lender engagement, provide realistic recovery timeline, request short-term waiver/forbearance | Alex / CFO |
| Crew shortages violate duty/currency regs | H | H | 1 | Reassign reserves, request regulatory flexibility for relief crew positioning; hire short-term contracted crew where permitted | Crew Manager / Oscar |
| Delayed parts deliveries from vendors | M | M | 4 | Explore alternate suppliers, expedite shipping, use interim repairs; evaluate cannibalization if legally compliant | Oscar / MRO |
| FX/payment delays prevent wet-lease payments | M | H | 2 | Prioritize providers accepting local currency; use intermediary payment services; request staged payments | Sara / Treasury |
| Customer dissatisfaction & brand damage | H | M | 2 | Proactive passenger communications, generous rebooking options, transparent timelines | Customer Care Lead |
| Lessor inspection triggers additional downtime | L | H | 3 | Keep lessors informed, involve lessor reps early, document MRO actions | Lisa / Oscar |

Note: Priority = Likelihood x Impact. Owners assigned are primary responsible; each mitigation should include a secondary owner and deadline.

## Communications — templates & playbook

A. Regulator call script (shortened, formal)
- Purpose: Give a clear factual status, demonstrate safety-first actions, and request narrowly scoped temporary flexibility if required.
- Opening:
  - “Good [time], this is Lisa Carter calling on behalf of Halcyon Air. We have an operational disruption impacting two aircraft and a significant cluster of crew sickness. No safety incidents to report. We are proactively contacting you to share our mitigation plan and to request your guidance and any temporary flexibility that would allow us to restore minimum essential service rapidly.”
- Key facts to have on hand:
  - Current number of AOGs; flight segments impacted; number of crew unavailable; actions taken (war-room, MRO engaged, wet-lease shortlist, route prioritisation).
- Ask examples:
  - “We request temporary flexibility to substitute aircraft type on route X for up to 7 days subject to safety checks.”
  - “We request confirmation whether wet-leased aircraft operated under these attachments would require immediate additional validation.”
- Close:
  - Confirm action items, note owners, agree next update time, and ask for any documentation required.

B. One-page lender summary (template content)
- Header: Halcyon Air — Operational Disruption Update (Date/Time)
- Situation snapshot: Two AOGs, crew sickness cluster, immediate impacts on schedule and cash.
- Cash position & 10-day runway under three scenarios (attach Excel).
- Actions already taken: war-room convened; AOG triage; wet-lease shortlist; regulator outreach planned.
- Ask: brief, time-bound (e.g., temporary waiver/forbearance of specific covenant for 30 days conditional upon achievement of operational milestone)
- Contact details & next update time.

C. Customer notification templates (e-mail/SMS)
- Short delay/cancellation message:
  - “Dear [Passenger], due to an operational disruption, your flight [flight number] scheduled for [date/time] has been [cancelled/delayed]. We sincerely apologise. We are re-accommodating affected customers on the next available service or with our partner carriers. Please see options: rebook, refund, or voucher. For urgent assistance call [hotline].”
- Include rebooking link, expected processing time, and outlines of compensation/assistances (meals/hotel if overnight).

D. Staff notification (internal)
- Tone: factual, empathetic, action-focused.
  - “Team — we are currently managing a multi-factor operational disruption. We appreciate your flexibility. Ops war-room is live; please update the crew roster and be available for reassignments. If you are unwell, please prioritise health and follow HR reporting procedures.”

E. Lessor notification template
- “We wish to inform you that aircraft [tail] is currently AOG due to [fault]. MRO engaged, expected RFS [ETA]. We will provide daily updates. Please advise if any lessor-specific inspections/steps are required.”

## Wet-lease procurement — scorecard & sample ranking
Use this table format in Sara’s shortlist. Fields should be populated for each provider and then scored.

Sample scoring matrix (example with three hypothetical providers)

| Provider | Type | Earliest A/C Ready | Days to Ferry | Daily Rate (USD) | Currency | Crew Included | Score (0–100) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|---:|---:|
| Provider A | A320 | 48h | 12h | 6,500 | USD only | Yes | 78 |
| Provider B | A321 | 24h | 8h | 7,200 | Local + staged | Yes | 84 |
| Provider C | Charter | 72h | 6h | 9,500 | Local | No | 62 |

Weighted criteria explained:
- Availability 30%
- Price 25%
- Currency/payment flexibility 15%
- Ferry time 10%
- Regulatory readiness 10%
- Crew included 10%

Recommendation: select top-ranked provider where score >75; if none meet threshold escalate to charter fallback.

---

## Cash & covenant scenarios (sample numbers — synthetic)
Note: These numbers are illustrative; Alex to replace with real bank balances and facility data.

Scenario summary (10-day outlook)

| Item | Baseline | Scenario A (Internal) | Scenario B (Wet-lease) | Scenario C (Pessimistic) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Opening cash (USD) | 18,000,000 | 18,000,000 | 18,000,000 | 18,000,000 |
| Expected receipts | 4,000,000 | 3,500,000 | 3,500,000 | 3,000,000 |
| Expected outflows (incl payroll) | 15,000,000 | 15,500,000 | 18,000,000 | 22,000,000 |
| Incremental wet-lease cost | 0 | 0 | 2,500,000 | 4,500,000 |
| Closing cash (projected) | 7,000,000 | 6,000,000 | 3,500,000 | -1,000,000 |
| Covenant breach (liquidity) | No | No | Possible | Yes |

Planned lender ask for Scenario C:
- Short-term covenant forbearance for liquidity covenant for 30 days; commitment to daily cash reporting and milestone deliverables (AOG RFS or wet-lease termination) to remove waiver.

Deliverable: attach detailed Excel with cash waterfall and sensitivity to FX assumptions.

---

## Passenger handling and customer care plan (detailed)
Aim: reduce passenger frustration and brand damage while minimizing cash leakage.

1) Rebooking options
   - Rebook on next Halcyon service at no fee.
   - Rebook on partner carriers where possible (commercial settlement later).
   - Offer full refund if passengers choose.

2) Ancillary compensation (policy for cancellations >6 hours or overnight)
   - Meals voucher: $15 (domestic) / $25 (international) per passenger.
   - Hotel + transfer for overnight delays if Halcyon is responsible (standard hotel rate + taxi).
   - Travel vouchers: discretionary up to $100 for high-value customers or for business accounts.

3) Communication cadence
   - Immediate SMS/e-mail on cancellation.
   - Follow-up within 4 hours with rebooking options.
   - For stranded passengers, provide on-ground assistance and escalation to Hub Recovery Team.

4) Customer-facing FAQ (quick answers)
   - “Can I get a refund?” — Yes, full refund or rebook at no fee.
   - “Will I be re-accommodated today?” — We will prioritise based on ticket type and time on ground; check your rebooking link.
   - “How will you keep me updated?” — SMS, email, and our service desk hotline.

5) VIP and corporate travel
   - Have dedicated contact lines for corporate accounts and frequent flyers.
   - Offer white-glove rebookings and additional compensation where commercially appropriate.

---

## MRO & AOG coordination checklist (Owner: Oscar)
Action items to compress AOG timelines:

- Confirm initial fault codes and provide immediate technical bulletin to MRO.
- Determine if on-site MRO capability exists; if not, plan ferry to nearest approved facility.
- Request parts priority shipping (overnight, air freight) and obtain cost/ETA estimates.
- Log parts availability alternatives (OEM, aftermarket, local pool).
- Create shift plan for MRO labour to expedite RFS.
- If lessor consent required for major work/cannibalisation, obtain immediate approval.
- Daily RFS status updates in the fleet sheet (every 6 hours initially).

---

## Crew triage rules & rostering protocol (Owner: Crew Manager)
Principles
- Safety and regulatory compliance first.
- Preserve minimum-service schedule across Tier 1 routes.
- Use reserves in a prioritized manner; avoid currency expiry due to reassignments.
- Maintain fair staffing rotation to avoid compounding sickness due to fatigue.

Steps
1) Validate crew health and expected return-to-duty times.
2) Freeze non-essential training that would pull crew from operational availability.
3) Implement contingency rosters: assign crew to Tier 1 flights first, then Tier 2.
4) If necessary, request regulated relief (e.g., duty extension request) only after regulator consult.
5) Keep HR & occupational health involved for contact tracing if cluster indicates contagion.

---

## Legal & lessor considerations (Owner: Legal / Lisa)
- Review standard lease clauses for lessor notification and cannibalisation.
- Confirm insurance coverage for wet-lease indemnities and passenger liabilities.
- Obtain written consents if changing aircraft configuration or applying non-standard operations.
- Track all commitments made to regulators and lenders.

---

## Assumptions, constraints & data quality expectations
- All owners must timestamp data uploads and ensure accuracy; last-sync timestamp will be used as single source of truth.
- Currency conversions must state FX rate and source (e.g., bank midday rate).
- Passenger counts and revenue-critical scores are estimates; commercial team must provide confidence band.
- No risky shortcuts on safety or regulatory compliance — any proposed exception must have regulator consultation and legal sign-off.

---

## Post-incident: lessons learned & follow-up actions (to be completed within 14 days)
- Conduct a formal Incident Review meeting to capture root causes, what went well, missed opportunities, and update playbooks.
- Update the wet-lease panel and pre-negotiate standing short-term agreements if feasible to speed future activations.
- Review crew resilience and health-monitoring practices; consider improved contingency roster policies.
- Consider renegotiating lender covenants or setting up a standby liquidity facility to reduce short-term cash vulnerability.
