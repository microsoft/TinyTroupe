    "content": "# BlueHarbor \u2013 Rapid Scoping Report: Microgrid Options, Immediate Asks & 6\u2011week Plan\n\nPrepared by: Lisa Carter (Wild Advice Partners)  \nStatus: Draft \u2014 please review and comment in the shared folder.\n\n---\n\n## Executive summary\n\nBlueHarbor has requested urgent support to stabilize electricity service and reduce costly diesel exposure across its island network. This rapid scoping pack provides a practical, phased approach to deliver an implementable set of technical and commercial options \u2014 prioritised, costed at high level, and investor\u2011ready by the end of a six\u2011week engagement.\n\nThis document:\n- Summarises the immediate diagnostic approach and quality checks we will run on the data.\n- Lists critical data and stakeholder asks needed within the next 24\u201348 hours to maintain schedule.\n- Proposes a detailed analytical and delivery plan for the next six weeks, with owners, deliverables, timelines and explicit outputs.\n- Provides sample templates, scoring matrices, and decision criteria that will be used to prioritise sites and options.\n- Surfaces key risks, probability/impact assessments and mitigations with owners.\n\nKey immediate ask of the client: provide secure access to the datasets listed below and confirm primary contacts for operations, treasury, procurement and regulator liaison within 24 hours where possible. Early access to time series load and outage data materially reduces uncertainty and delivers faster, higher\u2011fidelity outcomes.\n\nTarget outcome at 6 weeks: investor\u2011grade business case for an initial pilot microgrid(s) with modular options (small/medium/full), clear procurement path, a 30/60/90 day implementation sequencing and a lender/donor ready term\u2011sheet annex.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Context & objective\n\nContext\n- BlueHarbor operates multiple island electrification networks served predominantly by diesel generators. Recent volatility in fuel prices, logistics constraints and reliability concerns are generating unsustainable operating costs and elevated outage risk for customers and critical services.\n- The client seeks options that reduce diesel consumption and improve reliability while preserving the ability to access blended finance (donors + lenders) \u2014 i.e., a bankable business case with credible technical, commercial and procurement pathways.\n\nPrimary objective\n- Produce a prioritised, implementable set of technical and commercial options: pack\u2011size modular microgrids (containerised or prefabricated), CAPEX/OPEX trade\u2011offs, near\u2011term operational levers, and a medium\u2011term investor\u2011ready business case that preserves developer and lender confidence.\n\nScope\n- Island networks (multiple sites) within the BlueHarbor portfolio. Emphasis on:\n  - Short\u2011term diagnostics (first 5 business days) to identify priority pilot sites and quantify diesel exposure.\n  - Medium\u2011term investor\u2011ready package (6 weeks) including procurement annex, sensitivity analysis and term\u2011sheet draft.\n  - Deliverables tailored to both internal decision\u2011making (BlueHarbor board/excom) and external financing conversations (donor & lender info pack).\n\nBoundaries (what we will not deliver in 6 weeks)\n- Full detailed engineering design for site construction (e.g., civil drawings, full SCADA integration design). We will deliver technical spec annexes and procurement\u2011ready technical requirements.\n- Full EPC contracting and final vendor negotiations. We will prepare the term\u2011sheet, procurement approach and parallel vendor shortlists.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Rapid diagnostic (what we will do immediately)\n\nObjective for days 1\u20135\n- Convert raw data into actionable metrics that immediately indicate where diesel exposure and reliability risk are highest, and which sites are good candidates for near\u2011term modular microgrids or operational interventions.\n\nPrimary outputs\n- One\u2011page diagnostic per island (uniform template) summarising: peak and energy metrics, diesel burn and cost exposure, outage frequency/severity, candidate sites and siting constraints, immediate operational levers and high\u2011level CAPEX/OPEX band estimates.\n- Data appendix: validated raw time series (where possible), data quality log and assumptions.\n\nDetailed tasks and owners (Day 1\u20135)\n\n1.

Key levers we will evaluate (expanded)\n\nWe will quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the following levers for each candidate site:\n\n1. Pack sizing & productisation\n   - Options: containerised prefabricated microgrid (plug & play), site\u2011built hybrid system, staged modular build.\n   - Considerations: transport & crane constraints, local installation skills, future expandability, OPEX implications of modularity.\n\n2. Fuel & operational optimisations\n   - Improved dispatch strategies (battery first for peak shaving, genset spin\u2011up thresholds).\n   - Genset maintenance optimisation and life extension through load sharing and base loading.\n   - Fuel contract renegotiation opportunities: volume discounts, price indexing, delivery frequency and contingency clauses.\n   - Fuel theft mitigation and metering upgrades.\n\n3. Procurement & local supply options\n   - Regional vs global vendor trade\u2011offs (lead time vs cost).\n   - Availability of spares, local maintenance capacity and warranties.\n   - Local content requirements and customs clearance times.\n\n4. Financing structures (blended finance)\n   - Possible structures:\n     - Grant + concessional debt (donor covers % CAPEX to improve investor returns).\n     - Vendor financing + local bank refinance.\n     - Performance contracting with O&M provider; availability payments for reliability improvements.\n   - We will model the effect of different grant shares (10%, 25%, 50%) on payback and debt service coverage.\n\n5. Demand side measures (DSM)\n   - Targeted DSM where feasible: water pumping schedules, demand response for large consumers, LED retrofit programs.\n   - DSM can have low CAPEX and immediate impact on peak exposure.\n\n6. Hybrid technical levers\n   - Use of used/overhauled gensets where cost effective but with careful O&M considerations.\n   - PV plus battery integration where siting and insolation allow; prioritise where daytime loads are high.\n   - Microgrid controls: integrate supervisory controller for optimized dispatch and islanding functionality.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Estimated resource & cost envelope (high level)\n\nThis section provides Wild Advice\u2019s estimate of the internal resource allocation and a high\u2011level consulting fee envelope for the 6\u2011week rapid engagement (for client budgeting; final SOW to follow).\n\nEstimated internal team days\n- Lisa \u2013 Project lead & stakeholder engagement: 12 days\n- Alex \u2013 Data & modelling: 18 days\n- Oscar \u2013 Technical & siting: 12 days\n- Sara \u2013 Procurement & vendor engagement: 8 days\n- Marcos \u2013 Client liaison & admin: 4 days\n- Total consultant person\u2011days: 54 days\n\nIndicative fee estimate (excluding travel, taxes and vendor costs)\n- Daily rate assumptions (example):\n  - Senior lead (Lisa) USD 1,200/day\n  - Technical lead / modeller (Alex / Oscar) USD 900/day\n  - Procurement specialist (Sara) USD 700/day\n  - Project coordinator (Marcos) USD 500/day\n- Indicative total consulting fee: USD 54k \u2013 75k (range depends on seniority mix and client onsite requirements). Final quote to be issued following a quick SOW sign\u2011off.\n\nTravel & expenses\n- If site visits are required for pilot assessment in Week 2\u20134, separate travel estimate will be provided. We recommend at least one on\u2011site assessment for the top candidate pilot to validate siting constraints prior to RFP issuance.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Closing & ask to BlueHarbor\n\nWe are ready to start immediately upon receipt of the data and confirmation of client participants for the kickoff. To maintain the 6\u2011week delivery schedule we require:\n\nImmediate asks (again, succinctly):\n- Secure access to the datasets in Appendix A within 24\u201348 hours.\n- Confirmation of primary contacts for operations, treasury, procurement and the regulator.\n- Availability for a 30\u201345 minute kickoff in the next 24 hours (proposed time: [propose time based on client timezone]; please confirm or propose alternative).\n\nIf any of the above is not feasible, please indicate timings and blockers in the shared issue log so we can replan.\n\nWe aim to produce tangible, bankable outcomes \u2014 not just concepts. Our focus will be on actionable pilot(s) with clear procurement and financing paths so BlueHarbor can significantly reduce diesel exposure and improve supply reliability with minimal disruption.\n\nPrepared by: Lisa Carter (Wild Advice Partners)",
