            "description": "Piotr works primarily as a carpenter on residential renovation and small new-build projects. His role includes measuring and cutting timber, assembling and installing frames and interior fittings (flooring, door frames, kitchens), reading simple blueprints, coordinating with electricians and plumbers on site, and basic site cleanup. He often drives between small jobs in the Oslo area and occasionally helps load/unload materials. He is responsible for maintaining his personal set of hand tools, using power tools safely, and following site safety rules. He sometimes takes weekend side-jobs for neighbors (installing decking, building shelves), which supplements the household income. Strengths: practical problem-solving, steady hands, efficient on routine tasks. Challenges: limited formal certification (still working toward journeyman trade credentials), occasional difficulty with advanced technical blueprints, and stress when schedules change at short notice."
