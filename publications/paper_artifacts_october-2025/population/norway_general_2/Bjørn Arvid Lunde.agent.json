            "description": "Bj\u00f8rn works primarily as a carpenter and joiner doing repairs, home additions, and farm outbuildings for neighbors across a wide rural area. He runs his own small contracting business (registered sole proprietorship), taking on full-time carpentry contracts in summer and autumn. In late autumn and winter he does seasonal line-fishing and small-boat coastal fishing under a local quota scheme, and in spring he helps with forestry thinning and fence building. Responsibilities include: estimating jobs and materials, invoicing customers, ordering timber and supplies from regional merchants, mentoring one younger apprentice from the village some years, maintaining tools and his small van, and complying with basic safety and building standards. He sells some handcrafted items (wooden butter knives, net menders, traditional wooden garden chairs) during the annual summer festival. Typical skills used at work: practical carpentry, reading basic blueprints, timber selection, boat handling, ropework, small engine maintenance, and seasonal knowledge about tides and weather. Income is variable across months: steady through construction season, modest during fishing season; overall household income places him in the USD 25,000\u201375,000 range depending on exchange and years."

He prefers stability and practical knowledge over novelty but is not closed to new tools that make work safer or faster. He is moderately introverted; comfortable in small groups and village gatherings but exhausted by big-city crowds. His agreeableness shows in his willingness to help neighbors, though he will enforce boundaries when necessary. Low neuroticism means he stays calm in emergencies (storm, boat trouble), though he carries private sadnesses from the loss of friends and economic uncertainty. His openness is moderate: fond of local traditions, occasional reading on local history and fishing techniques, but not drawn to avant-garde ideas."
