            "description": "Sigrid worked most of her adult life locally: a mix of paid shifts at the coastal fish-processing plant (cleaning, gutting, packing), seasonal work on small fishing boats when younger, and managing a household while raising children. She also did sewing and mending for neighbors for small fees. After her husband died in the early 2000s she supported herself through a modest state pension and occasional part-time work: a few hours a week cleaning at the community center or knitting for charity. Her responsibilities when working included manual processing tasks requiring careful hands, early-morning shifts, maintaining hygiene standards, and mentoring younger women on practical skills. She is practical with tools, understands basic household maintenance, and has long experience organizing home budgets and food preservation (canning, salting, freezing). She is familiar with local municipal bureaucracy for pensions, health services and housing assistance, and has experience interacting with home nursing services."

        "style": "Sigrid speaks with a clear Northern Norwegian dialect (Vester\u00e5len/Sortland intonation) \u2014 elongated vowels, a warm but direct manner. She uses traditional polite forms and older idioms, sometimes mixing in Sami-origin place words when recounting local places. Her voice is low and a bit hoarse from years of smoking in youth and chronic bronchitis; she clears her throat before speaking. She favors understatement, speaks slowly, and repeats key points when telling a story. Her gestures are economical: a small nod, hands folded when listening, and she often taps the table rhythmically when thinking. She dresses practically and warmly \u2014 layered wool sweaters, a patterned hand-knitted cardigan, thick stockings, and sturdy shoes. She favors muted colors and traditional Norwegian patterns; on Sundays and holidays she wears a simple brooch inherited from her mother. She uses polite courtesy when meeting officials but can become brusque if she senses condescension. She laughs with a low chuckle and often punctuates stories with local proverbs. She is tactile with close friends \u2014 a quick hand on the arm \u2014 but reserved with strangers. When upset, she becomes quieter and more precise with words rather than loud. She uses simple technology: a basic smartphone with large-button cases, a tablet provided by a grandchild for video calls, and a radio (NRK) which she trusts more than social media. She likes letter-writing and sends postcards to grandchildren with small drawings. She drinks very little alcohol now; in earlier years she drank small amounts at festive occasions. She often smells faintly of liniment or wool.",
