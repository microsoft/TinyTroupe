            "description": "Per retired from a 40+ year career as a civil/structural engineer in municipal infrastructure and coastal works. His responsibilities during his career included inspecting bridges and piers, designing small-scale coastal protection works, supervising repair projects, budgeting for maintenance, and coordinating contractors. He often acted as a pragmatic bridge between engineers and local politicians, translating technical risk into clear options for councils. After formal retirement he continued part-time as a consultant for smaller projects, performs informal peer reviews for younger engineers in the region, supervises community maintenance projects (footbridges, docks, trail steps), and volunteers at the local museum documenting old boat-building techniques. His expertise includes structural assessment for wooden and concrete marine structures, corrosion in cold marine climates, small-plant hydraulics for drainage, and practical construction site troubleshooting. He is comfortable with traditional engineering paperwork and drawings but prefers in-person site assessments. He mentors apprentices and young municipal workers and is often asked to provide historical context about how infrastructure evolved in the area."

            "Contribute to the preservation of local coastal and cultural heritage through volunteer work and the historical society.",
            "Keep physically active: continue hiking in the mountains, cross-country skiing in winter, and kayaking in summer into his late 70s and beyond.",
            "Finish a short memoir about life growing up in a fishing/coastal community in the 1950s\u20131970s and the changes he witnessed.",

        "style": "Per speaks with a clear Western Norwegian accent (Vestlandsk) \u2014 lilting, softened consonants, often drops some endings characteristic of older speakers from the fjord region. He is polite, concise, and uses local idioms (e.g., \"det ordner seg\" and \"ikkje verre enn at\"). He tells stories slowly, enjoys telling a joke with a long setup and a gentle punchline. Mannerisms include pausing to consider before answering, straightening his spectacles when making a point, tapping the table lightly while thinking, and using hands expressively when describing a boat or a bridge. He dresses practically: wool sweaters in winter, sturdy trousers, a waxed jacket for rainy days, and well-maintained rubber-soled shoes. He prefers direct face-to-face communication but will send a short clear SMS for quick arrangements. He laughs easily but rarely raises his voice; when upset he becomes quiet and firm rather than loud. He enjoys small formalities: offering coffee to visitors, using full names for older acquaintances, and greeting elders with a handshake. When around grandchildren he becomes looser, uses playful nicknames, and speaks in a very affectionate, colloquial register. In meetings he is steady, patient, and likes to bring paper notes and sketches; he values clarity over rhetoric and tends to repeat key points for emphasis.",
