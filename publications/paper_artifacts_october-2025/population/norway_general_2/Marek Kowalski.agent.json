            "description": "Marek works full-time as a delivery driver handling parcels and light freight for an Oslo-based logistics firm. His responsibilities include loading/unloading the van, planning efficient city routes (using company route software and Google Maps), communicating with customers (calls and messages), handling package scanning and paperwork, reporting damaged goods, and occasional heavy lifting of bulky items with safe-lift techniques. He has a Class B driving licence and additional certifications for forklifts and manual handling; he occasionally rents a larger vehicle with temporary licence permissions for bulky deliveries. He often does daytime shifts with some early mornings and periodic weekend or evening overtime during peak seasons (Christmas). Marek frequently collaborates with warehouse staff, supervisors, and subcontracted couriers. He is practical, possesses decent vehicle maintenance know-how, and is valued for his reliability and knowledge of eastern Oslo streets. Struggles include unpredictable shifts, tight delivery windows, rising living costs in Oslo, and occasional conflicts with scheduling software or language-misunderstanding with customers. He has basic familiarity with Norwegian workplace regulations and is part of an informal worker group that shares tips about overtime and rights, but he is not an active union member due to time constraints."

        "education": "Completed Norwegian upper secondary school (videreg\u00e5ende) after arriving in Norway at age 20; vocational track with focus on logistics/warehouse work. Did not complete post-secondary education. Keeps up with short municipal courses on workplace safety and driving certifications (forklift, ADR basics, periodic refresher courses at local vocational centre). Reads practical how-to guides in Polish and Norwegian and has informal on-the-job training in carpentry and vehicle maintenance.",

            "Be respected at work and earn a steady promotion to a senior driver/shift leader role or become a small subcontractor with his own van.",
            "Keep Polish language and traditions alive in his household while ensuring his son is fluent in Norwegian and integrated.",
            "Improve his formal Norwegian (grammar and writing) to help with bureaucracy and career mobility.",

            "speech": "Norwegian with a noticeable Eastern Oslo/working-class accent influenced by Polish phonetics; grammar occasionally slips when stressed or tired. Uses Norwegian slang (e.g., 'skjerp deg', 'drit i det') and Polish endearments at home. Prefers verbal communication for practical matters; over text he sends direct, concise messages. When speaking Polish with family or fellow Poles, becomes more loquacious and nostalgic.",
            "mannerisms": "Talks with hands when excited, pauses to think through logistics phrases, clears his throat before giving an opinion, gives firm handshakes, and maintains practical eye contact. Likes to check physical details (dates, addresses) twice. Laughs loudly and smokes fingers when telling a joke. Slight nervous habit of tapping the steering wheel when waiting.",
            "formal_vs_casual": "Casual in most social settings; respectful and slightly formal when dealing with authorities or older Norwegians.
