            "description": "Oskar is a typical 12-year-old pupil. His primary daily role is as a student at the local school where classes are small and practical skills are emphasized alongside the national curriculum. Outside school hours he has responsibilities at home: stacking firewood, helping maintain the family boat, feeding a small dog and sometimes helping his father check lobster pots or move gear. In summer he helps with simple tasks on a neighbour's small fishing boat and sometimes guides younger cousins on short hikes. He is building hands-on skills: knot tying, basic engine checks, using a jigsaw and hand planer under supervision. Socially his 'work' includes being a reliable friend who organises games, cleaning up after group activities, and occasionally babysitting younger neighbours for short periods. He has a growing interest in mechanics and small craft maintenance and shows aptitude for practical problem solving rather than abstract schoolwork."
