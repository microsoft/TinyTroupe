            "description": "Sofie is primarily a 9th-grade student who has taken on the role of primary daytime caregiver for her infant child; she shares childcare duties with her mother and grandmother. Her 'work' consists of feeding (breastfeeding and bottle where applicable), diaper changes, naps and playtime scheduling, preparing simple meals, going to health centre appointments, and maintaining contact with the child's father and health professionals. She sometimes does babysitting for neighbours for pocket money (small local jobs: 1\u20133 hours) and helped with small household cleaning and grocery shopping. She is learning to fill out forms related to benefits (with parental help), schedule vaccinations, and arrange preschool enrollment when the child reaches the right age. Relevant skills include basic infant care, scheduling, basic budgeting, using public transport with a stroller, and informal negotiation with family members about responsibilities."

When stressed she speaks quickly and in clipped sentences; when relaxed, she laughs loudly and tells small stories.
