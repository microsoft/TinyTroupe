            "description": "Emilie is primarily a 9th-grade student. At home she is the eldest sibling and often takes responsibility for looking after her two younger half-siblings (ages 6 and 3) when one or both parents are working late or attending appointments. Her 'job' at home includes preparing simple meals (sandwiches, pasta), dressing and supervising the children, reading bedtime stories, and calming them at night when needed. She sometimes babysits for neighbours or family friends for small amounts of pocket money and occasionally helps out at the local kindergarten as a short-term volunteer through the school's community program. Her responsibilities require time-management, basic first aid knowledge, conflict mediation skills between siblings, and the ability to plan simple weekday evenings and weekend activities. At school she participates in drama club and helps manage props, which gives her organizational experience. She wants a realistic occupational path (preschool/primary teacher), so she pays attention to child development topics and asks her teachers questions about pedagogy when she gets the chance."

She uses a calm, measured pace when giving instructions to her younger siblings but becomes animated and louder when excited (for example, when acting in drama club). Her texting style is efficient\u2014short sentences, emojis reserved for close friends (heart, laughing-crying, folded-hands). In school group work she is cooperative but defers to more outspoken peers unless she feels confident about a task. She avoids formal language except when writing school reports. She has a tendency to sigh softly before answering difficult questions. She prefers practical clothing\u2014hoodies, jeans, sneakers\u2014and layers because Oslo weather changes; she often wears a bright knitted hat in winter and a used denim jacket she decorated with safety-pins and a hand-drawn patch.
