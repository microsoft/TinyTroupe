            "description": "Kari works as a shift supervisor in a supermarket in eastern Oslo. Her responsibilities include opening and closing the store when scheduled, creating staff rosters for small teams, training new cashiers and temporary staff, handling cash and bank deposits, resolving customer complaints, basic ordering and stock rotation, labeling fresh produce, and ensuring hygiene and safety standards are met. She occasionally steps in on the floor during busy times and does cashier shifts herself when understaffed. She has informal responsibility for petty cash reconciliation and small local vendor relations (baker, produce supplier). She is experienced at de-escalation with upset customers and at motivating a largely young, part-time staff. She has practical knowledge of POS systems used by Norwegian grocery chains, basic inventory spreadsheets, and municipal health inspection requirements. Her major difficulties are shift unpredictability, seasonal short staffing, and pressure from store management to hit weekly sales targets with limited staffing."

Uses a mix of Norwegian and some English phrases when talking about technology or products ('app', 'check', 'online'). In public she is polite, uses the typical Norwegian reserve for strangers but quickly relaxes into chatty, humorous talk with known customers and neighbors. Her mannerisms: fiddles with a keyring or the edge of her jacket when thinking, smiles with a small laugh to soften criticism, leans forward when listening, often gestures with hands when explaining something. She prefers practical clothing: sneakers, jeans, layered knit jumpers and a bright scarf in winter. She speaks plainly, avoids long formal speeches, and values clarity and fairness. When stressed she speaks faster and uses short sentences; when calm she tells stories and adds small, self-deprecating jokes. Her written tone (texts, messages) is succinct but friendly; she often uses emojis when messaging close friends. She hates unnecessary small talk at length but appreciates sincere compliments. She is punctual for work, but late for purely social events if childcare or transport complicates things.",
