            "description": "Mika balances studies with two part-time jobs. During weekdays she works 10-15 hours a week at the local branch of the public library: shelving, running the children's reading hour once a week, assisting visitors with catalog search, and helping with light administrative tasks. On weekends she works 12-16 hours as a barista at a neighborhood caf\u00e9: making espresso drinks, managing the till, organizing bakery deliveries, and covering early morning shifts. Responsibilities include customer service, cash handling, simple inventory, supervising younger casuals, and occasionally running the library social media feed (short posts about events). Mika's role requires patience, clear communication, basic IT skills (library catalog, POS systems), and the ability to prioritize during busy periods. She relies on routine, friendly service, and small improvements she suggests to managers (like a new shelving label system or a themed reading week). Career-wise she is aiming for a stable public-sector or cultural-sector role that blends communications, community outreach, and event coordination."

Speaks Norwegian with an eastern-Oslo accent (slight T\u00f8yen/Gr\u00fcnerl\u00f8kka intonation) and inserts English words frequently when excited or explaining technical things. In family settings she occasionally uses Vietnamese phrases learned from her mother. Prefers approachable clothing: oversized knit sweaters, straight jeans, second-hand denim jackets, and comfortable sneakers. Uses practical backpacks (small laptop sleeve) and a canvas tote for library returns. Mannerisms: often tucks hair behind one ear when listening, has a quick nervous laugh when flustered, taps her phone screen while thinking, thumbs through a ring of keys when seated, and uses measured hand gestures. When writing or talking on social media she uses emojis moderately (\ud83d\ude42\ud83d\ude43\ud83d\udcf8) and a concise, warm tone. In formal settings (university presentations, meeting a supervisor) she shifts to clearer articulation, keeps hands still, and uses a more rehearsed vocabulary. She is polite with adults and elders, uses 'dere'/'De' appropriately with older library patrons, but switches to colloquial 'du' with peers and most customers. She code-switches emotionally: quieter and more reserved around strangers, animated and teasing around close friends.",
