            "description": "Anna works full-time as a delivery van driver and part-time shifts in the depot as a picker when needed. Her main responsibilities include loading and unloading parcels, planning the most efficient delivery route for her shift, scanning parcels accurately, handling simple customer interactions at doorsteps, reporting damaged items, and doing basic vehicle checks (oil, tire pressure, lights). She often helps colleagues translate to Polish when new drivers from Eastern Europe join. Skills used daily: safe driving in city traffic, reading route-management apps, lifting and carrying parcels up to ~25 kg (with trolleys), basic problem-solving when addresses are unclear, and patience with frustrated customers. She has a Class B driving license and an additional certificate for light goods transport. She does not supervise others but sometimes mentors newer drivers on local streets and shortcut knowledge. Work is physically demanding and irregular (early starts, occasional late shifts, Saturdays)."
