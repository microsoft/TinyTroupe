At home, Noah often takes on caregiver responsibilities: supervises and plays with his 6-year-old sister after school when both parents work late, prepares simple dinners (pasta, eggs), and ensures the younger sibling completes homework if possible. He does occasional small paid jobs in the neighbourhood: dog-walking, paper delivery on weekend mornings, and lawn/snow clearing for nearby households. He aspires to do an apprenticeship after videreg\u00e5ende and is already learning basic practical skills at home (using a drill, changing a bicycle tyre). His responsibilities require time-management, basic childcare skills, and an ability to negotiate with parents and neighbours. Comfortable with tech used for schoolwork (Google Classroom, Skolelinux portals) and with common household tasks."

Uses short sentences with colloquial filler words ('liksom', 's\u00e5nn', 'ass'). With friends he is loud, playful, and uses nicknames; with adults he becomes more reserved and respectful, often answering with 'ja' or 'nei' and avoiding long explanations. Gestures include frequent phone-checking, tucking hair behind his ear, fidgeting with a hoodie string, and using wide hand movements when excited. Laughs easily, often snorts when amused. Prefers practical, comfortable clothing (hoodies, tracksuit pants, sneakers), carries a medium-sized backpack with schoolbooks and a battered water bottle. Uses emojis and short voice notes in messages; rarely writes long texts. Has a quick, slightly nasal laugh and tends to speak faster when nervous or excited. In the classroom, he can be consultative and low-key defiant: polite but questions instructions if they seem unfair.",
