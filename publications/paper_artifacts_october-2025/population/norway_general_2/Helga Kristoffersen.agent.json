            "description": "Spent 35 years as a primary school teacher in municipal schools in Western Norway, specialising in grades 1-4. Responsibilities included lesson planning, reading and numeracy instruction, classroom management, parent-teacher communication, coordinating school concerts and local history projects, and mentoring younger teachers. After retirement at 67, she continued occasional substitute teaching during busy periods and school events. Today she volunteers 6\u201312 hours per week at the municipal library (cataloguing local donations, running children's reading hours) and organizes a small local history lecture series with the community centre. Skills: classroom pedagogy, lesson differentiation, child development knowledge, basic classroom first aid, event organisation, public speaking to modest audiences, report writing for municipal meetings, and interpersonal conflict resolution between parents and school staff. Comfortable with analogue administrative tasks (paper records) and basic digital tools (email, word processing)."

Uses polite forms and traditional greetings (handshake with acquaintances, air-kiss with close female friends). In conversation she often weaves in local sayings, references to fjords and weather, and small anecdotes about her childhood. Prefers face-to-face conversation but is competent on the phone. When writing (emails, letters), she is precise and slightly formal: short salutations, neatly structured paragraphs, and a habit of closing with a sentence referencing health or family. Little use of slang; mild sarcasm reserved for close family. Mannerisms include smoothing her skirt when sitting, stroking her chin when thinking, tapping a spoon rhythmically when waiting for tea to brew, and a habit of starting sentences with 'You know...' when telling a story. In public she dresses neatly but practically: wool sweaters, practical waterproof coats, knitted scarves in autumn, and sturdy shoes for walking. Prefers clear, plain language and often simplifies modern tech-speak into everyday metaphors (calls a smartphone her 'small telephone with pictures').",
