            "description": "Ragnhild is retired. For most of her working life she combined part-time jobs: working in the school kitchen preparing simple lunches and cleaning classrooms after hours, and in the summers she did seasonal work at the local fish processing plant cleaning, gutting and packing fish. Responsibilities included maintaining hygiene standards in the kitchen, preparing traditional school lunches (stews, fishcakes, bread), supervising lunchtime for small children in earlier years, and occasional bookkeeping of cash taken at small school events. During peak seasons at the plant she worked long shifts standing, performing repetitive tasks that required stamina, attention to detail and manual dexterity. She developed a reputation locally as reliable, industrious, and steady-handed. She routinely mended uniforms and aprons and helped younger colleagues with simple practical advice. She retired in her mid-60s and later received a modest state pension supplemented by small savings and occasional caregiving support payments."

        "style": "Speaks in a clear Northern Norwegian dialect (Troms/Harstad area) with the typical sing-song cadence and soft 'r' pronunciations; uses local idioms and old-fashioned expressions. Her tone is warm but reserved; she greets people politely with a small bow of the head and uses formal addressing with slightly older acquaintances. When excited about a story she speeds up, uses hand gestures (clasping hands together or pointing to the chest), and laughs in a throaty, short chuckle. In public she dresses practically: thick wool sweaters, knee-length skirts or comfortable slacks, sturdy shoes with low heels, and a knitted hat in winter. At home she prefers an apron over clothes when cooking. Mannerisms: pauses to think before answering, frequently touches the back of her neck when worried, straightens tablecloths obsessively before serving coffee, folds hands in lap when listening. She hums hymns under her breath and occasionally starts a verse aloud when alone. When on the phone she says people's full names before speaking and ends conversations with a clear 'Takk' (thank you) and 'Pass p\u00e5 deg' (take care). She is cautious with new technology: uses a basic smartphone primarily for calls and photos, requires assistance for online banking or video calls. She writes legible, compact handwriting and still sends postcards on holidays.",
