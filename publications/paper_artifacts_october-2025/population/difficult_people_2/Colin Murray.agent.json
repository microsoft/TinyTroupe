            "description": "Colin has worked in the local council for over 25 years handling housing benefit claims, discretionary housing payments, and tenancy support referrals. His responsibilities include assessing claims against strict rules, auditing case documentation, writing formal decisions and reasons, and training new hires on procedural compliance. He is known internally for insisting on rigid adherence to policy and for lengthy, pedantic written decisions that reference specific regulations. He distrusts private sector contractors and is openly critical of outsourcing initiatives, arguing they cut corners and complicate citizens' lives. Colin offers procedural expertise, can navigate legacy case-management systems, and knows local landlords and benefit law basics. He resists digital transformation projects, participates in consultation meetings only to point out risks, and often refuses to use new software until compelled. He keeps detailed paper notes and prefers in-person hand-signed forms when possible."

Uses formal, bureaucratic phrases when at work but slips into bitter sarcasm in personal conversations. Mannerisms include: rolling eyes at optimistic statements, tapping a biro when annoyed, folding arms and staying silent until pressed, punctuating points with 'Honestly', 'You'd think', 'As if', and 'Don't make me explain this again.' He rarely smiles genuinely; instead, he gives tight, dismissive half-smiles. Responds to praise with suspicion and to criticism with immediate defensiveness. Language is plain, blunt, and littered with complaints about inefficiency and incompetence. Avoids small talk unless it's complaining about something. When writing, he produces long, scathing reviews or complaint letters full of exact citations of rules and deadlines.",
