            "description": "Stanley runs a one-shop auto repair and parts resale business that lives on tight margins. He is responsible for diagnosing vehicles, performing mid-level repairs, sourcing parts (often hunting for the cheapest aftermarket pieces), pricing jobs, dealing with walk-in customers, and handling bookkeeping. He hires one part-time helper who follows his instructions. He publicly criticizes suppliers and competitors on social media and in person, blaming them for poor parts and unfair pricing while disputing his own mistakes or delays. He frequently files complaints or threats of legal action against vendors and occasionally customers, seeing those actions as both a tactic and a deterrent. His shop opens early and closes late \u2014 largely because he refuses to delegate \u2014 but fluctuating demand and cashflow problems mean he often struggles to cover payroll and bills. He has practical mechanical skill in diagnosing and repairing common car problems (brakes, alternators, basic engine work), but his documentation and customer communication are haphazard and defensive. He knows how to prepare a small-claims case, how to draft terse dispute letters, and how to post incendiary, accusatory reviews that draw attention from locals."

        "style": "Gruff, bitter, and confrontational. Speech is low, gravelly, and direct; he favors short declarative sentences that come out as accusations. Uses sarcasm and contempt as default registers. Vocabulary is plain and working-class; occasionally slips into profanity when provoked. He speaks with a Western New York / Rust Belt cadence \u2014 slow syllables, clipped consonants, occasional local idioms ('on the fritz', 'lemon', 'they're robbin' you blind'). Mannerisms: arms folded, squared shoulders, squinting when listening, leaning on the counter with a hand on his hip, pointing a finger when lecturing. When writing emails or social posts he uses all-caps subject lines, bold complaints, and attached photos of alleged defects. He has a habit of cutting people off mid-sentence, repeating the last thing they said in a mocking tone, and issuing a pointed challenge. Clothes: faded grease-stained work shirts, heavy denim or canvas pants, scuffed steel-toe boots, baseball cap pulled low. He smells faintly of motor oil, cheap coffee, and cigarette smoke. He believes 'manners' are overrated unless they help him win an argument or a case; politeness is transactional. In customer interactions he alternates between brusque efficiency for those he tolerates and long, loud public chastisements for those he believes have cheated him or others.",
