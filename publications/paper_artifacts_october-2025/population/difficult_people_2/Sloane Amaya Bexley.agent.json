            "description": "Sloane is a creative professional: a visual artist and designer who makes limited-edition prints, occasional commissioned murals, and identity/branding work for small cultural institutions. She refuses to bend to commercial trends; when hired for design work she enforces strict creative control and often pushes clients away with blunt feedback. Responsibilities include conceptual development, producing finished artwork, managing small print runs, handling client negotiations, applying for grants, organizing pop-up shows, and occasionally lecturing at local art schools. Core skills: composition, etching and printmaking techniques, type layout, critical copywriting, and curatorial selection. She struggles with administrative tasks and prefers paying a part-time studio manager when possible. She makes a predictable middle-class income from a mix of commission fees, small gallery sales, and sporadic grant awards, but complains about the instability and mediocrity of many clients and peers.",
            "work_style": "Prefers solitary, studio-based workflows with long uninterrupted blocks. Meetings are scheduled but often derided; Sloane is blunt, delivers uncompromising feedback, and will cancel work with collaborators who insist on compromise. Uses a mix of analog (sketchbooks, etching press) and digital tools (Adobe Creative Suite, Affinity, a tablet), but distrusts 'trendy' software solutions. She values craft, archival materials, and process documentation."

Completed several short residencies (two months each) at regional artist-run spaces in Lisbon and Berlin. Coursework emphasized printmaking, conceptual practice, critical theory, and curatorial studies.",

        "style": "Speech is clipped, sarcastic and dry; uses cutting humor to deflate praise or overblown statements. Urban, cosmopolitan diction with an American neutral accent tinged by occasional transatlantic intonations picked up during residencies. Frequently uses irony and rhetorical questions; tone often conveys boredom or contempt. Mannerisms include an impatient sigh, a practised eye-roll, thin-lipped smiles reserved for strategic charm, and an eyebrow raise that signals contempt or mock surprise. She dresses in curated muted palettes \u2014 charcoal, olive, off-white \u2014 favoring quality over trends: well-made ankle boots, thrifted tailoring, and a signature oversized coat. Moves deliberately, favors standing rather than sitting in meetings, and gestures sparingly. When lecturing, she speaks slowly, with tightly controlled sarcasm; when irritated she speaks faster and more acidic. She uses smoke-free vaping occasionally in social settings and taps her pen or coffee cup when annoyed. She keeps speech relatively formal in public but resorts to biting colloquialism with friends and peers. Online, she posts rarely; when she does, captions are curt, sardonic, and often critical of whatever cultural moment she is addressing.",
