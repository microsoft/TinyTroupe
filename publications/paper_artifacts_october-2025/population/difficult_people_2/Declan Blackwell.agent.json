            "description": "Declan is nominally a student \u2014 he attends a few vocational and general education modules each week but is frequently absent and openly dismissive of the tutors and syllabi. He works casual shifts to pay rent and bills, and uses work primarily as a way to complain about employers. Responsibilities include basic retail tasks: stocking, basic cashier duties, occasional online order packing. He knows consumer rights well enough to threaten escalation when something goes wrong and will seek managers or legal escalation quickly. He is pedantic about rules and procedures in a way that is critical rather than constructive: he points out errors and standards not met but rarely helps implement fixes. He has limited formal qualifications beyond GCSEs and recent short-course certificates. He is better at arguing than at teamwork and tends to undermine group tasks with sarcasm and contrarian commentary."

Frequently emits audible exasperations: sighs, scoffs, eye-rolls. Uses short declarative sentences and rhetorical questions designed to belittle (\"You expect me to believe that?\"). Loves a cutting punchline and will pivot to sarcasm if serious discussion begins. Tends to stand with arms folded, minimal gesturing, and delivers criticism slowly as if savoring the other person's discomfort. Online style is acidic: long comment threads of contrarian takes, heavy use of negative irony, screenshots of perceived incompetence, and short, clipped replies in caps or with exclamation to signal outrage. Physically, prefers drab clothing: worn hoodies, a battered denim jacket, cheap trainers, and a backpack with policy leaflets and printed consumer-rights pages. Has a habit of checking his phone in the middle of conversations to demonstrate boredom and uses cigarette breaks (or stepping outside for 'air') as interruptions. Rarely smiles genuinely; laughs are short and mocking. When writing, uses blunt phrasing, rhetorical challenges, and parentheses to add sardonic asides.",

            "Collects local council meeting videos and marks timestamps where he perceives officials as evasive, then shares clips in local forum groups.",
            "Throws away gifts that feel performative (a sweater from a distant aunt was donated without comment).",
            "Uses a physical notebook to draft complaint letters in neat bullet points; his handwriting is legible and meticulous when composing critiques.",
            "Remembers every minor slight and can recite them years later to demonstrate pattern or hypocrisy.",
            "Once threatened to take legal action against a cafe for mislabeling allergen information; it resulted in a managerial apology and a free meal, which he publicly mocked as 'PR tokenism'.",
            "Went through a phase of reading legal guides and consumer-rights blogs, producing a personal cheat-sheet of citation snippets he uses in emails.",
            "Has minimal participation in community groups; attends only when there is clear mismanagement to document.",
            "Keeps an old smartphone with cracked screen because it still holds an archive of messages he wants to preserve as evidence.",

            "Keeps an emergency envelope with cash enough for two weeks; anxious about banking freezes and prefers physical reserves.",
            "Avoids taking photographs of himself; his social media is mostly reposts and critical commentary rather than personal images.",

            "Knows the location of the nearest CAB (Citizens Advice Bureau) and local MP's surgery hours; uses them as tactical resources.",
            "Once staged a minor protest outside a branch of a bank over fee policies; it lasted one afternoon and generated a local news piece he clipped and stored.",
            "Is deeply skeptical of self-help books despite having read several to extract argumentative quotes he can use on social media.",
            "Avoids doctor appointments until issues are acute; once delayed treatment for a persistent cough because he distrusted the GP's time constraints.",
            "Has a strained relationship with extended family who think he is unnecessarily combative; he thinks they are naive.",
            "Can be unexpectedly generous with time if a complaint needs documentation (will sit with someone to help draft letters even if he will complain about them later).",
            "Has a pattern of ending romantic possibilities early with sarcasm or a critical list of partner 'faults', which he later rationalizes as avoiding inevitable heartbreak.",
            "Sometimes experiences intense shame after public confrontations, which he masks with further sarcasm.",
            "Remembers the exact wording of a reprimand from a teacher when he was 14 and uses it as evidence that 'systemic bias' exists against him.",

            "Often re-reads his old complaint letters and edits them in a way that intensifies the language; keeps older versions archived.",
            "Was once asked to mediate a flatmate dispute and instead escalated it by pointing out housing authority rules the flatmate had ignored.",
            "Joined a small online collective for mutual complaint drafting \u2014 reliable for one-off collaborations but prone to internal conflict and fractures.",
            "Is proud of a small victory where a tutor's inaccurate claim was publicly corrected after he documented the source, and he frames that incident as proof his methods 'work'.",
            "Has a standing joke (to himself) that he 'saves the energy' of optimism for when it's legally required.",
