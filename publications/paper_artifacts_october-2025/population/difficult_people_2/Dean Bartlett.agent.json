Responsibilities include on-site measurement and layout, bespoke cabinetry and staircases, door and window fitting, repair work and small renovations. Runs his own van, sources materials from local builders' merchants, quotes jobs, manages a small roster of subcontractors when a job needs more hands. Skilled with hand tools and basic power tools; values traditional methods and precise craft. Often inspects others' work and is quick to criticize shoddy practices. Keeps a ledger for expenses and invoices clients himself; dislikes paperwork and fights HMRC correspondence when it appears. Typical problems: impatient with delays, suspicious of newer materials or techniques, prone to publicly complaining about suppliers, and sometimes takes disputes to small claims court rather than negotiate verbally.",
