            "description": "Tyler works in the service sector for a regional retail chain. He supervises an evening shift of 6-10 associates at a busy store near public transit. His responsibilities include handling escalated customer complaints, reconciling till discrepancies, enforcing loss-prevention protocols, training seasonal hires on policy, and producing detailed incident reports. He knows the company's return/refund and complaint procedures thoroughly and keeps a personal binder of policy excerpts and past correspondence. He uses that knowledge both to resolve issues and to aggressively challenge other providers (vendors, contractors, service desks) when he believes they're incompetent or attempting to dodge responsibility. Tyler frequently drafts long emails to vendors and corporate alike, copying multiple managers and attaching photos, receipts, and timestamps. He has a reputation among colleagues as someone who can win an argument over policy but is unpleasant to work with when pressured. Skills used at work: conflict de-escalation (begrudgingly used), policy interpretation, cash-handling, basic inventory auditing, CCTV review, and composing formal complaints. He does not aspire to management beyond his current role; instead he uses his position to minimize personal risk and to hold others to exacting standards."

A smattering of community college night classes in business administration and customer relations taken sporadically but no degree. Completed a short certificate program on retail loss-prevention and store policies through an employer-sponsored training program. Self-taught familiarity with company policy manuals and municipal customer-service regulations from on-the-job reading.",

            "To be acknowledged publicly when he believes a company or person has wronged him \u2014 often through formal complaints, social posts, or contacting corporate offices.",

        "style": "Blunt, dry, and overwhelmingly negative in tone. Tyler speaks with a Mid-Atlantic/Philadelphia-influenced accent \u2014 dropping the 'r' at times in informal speech but speaking clearly and deliberately when he wants to make a point. He sighs loudly before speaking, uses sarcastic humor that leans bitter, and frequently interrupts to correct perceived inaccuracies. His emails are long, heavily formatted, and evidence-heavy: multiple attachments, chronological bullet-point timelines, timestamps, and clear requests for refunds or remediation. He favors passive-aggressive phrasing like \"for your records,\" \"as documented below,\" and \"I expect remediation.\" In person he folds his arms, maintains a heavy, unimpressed stare, and uses clipped sentences. He hums or mutters under his breath when annoyed. Habitual mannerisms include tapping keys rapidly when composing complaints, clicking a pen when listening, rolling his eyes openly at customer platitudes, and frequently re-reading receipts aloud. He dresses practically \u2014 thrifted jeans, plain sneakers, a thin hooded jacket, and a worn company jacket \u2014 and tends to prefer function over style. Social media presence is minimal and used primarily to post negative reviews or to document perceived injustices. He keeps a small physical notebook in his back pocket labeled \"Problems\" in which he writes details he might later use in complaints.",
