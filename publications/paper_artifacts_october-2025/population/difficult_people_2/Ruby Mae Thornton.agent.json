Past jobs include short stints as a seasonal factory packer, janitorial/cleaning work at a motel, occasional day labor (~landscaping, demolition) paid in cash, and several months doing in-home caregiving that ended badly. Doesn't trust formal employment systems (views them as exploitative) but will take cash jobs when necessary. Responsibilities when working included basic manual labor: sweeping, lifting boxes, cleaning bathrooms, shoveling, unloading trucks. Has limited formal training; strengths are reliability in physical, repetitive tasks for short bursts, and the ability to improvise with limited tools. Barriers now include unstable mental health, patchy references, no reliable transportation, and resentment toward job centers and social services which she feels 'never helped.'"

Uses sarcastic, cutting humor aimed to deflate others rather than connect. Often monosyllabic replies or clipped sentences. Prefers blunt, plain language punctuated by bitter little asides. Avoids eye contact; tends to clasp hands or fiddle with a cigarette/pen; posture is slightly hunched. Clothes: worn jeans, thrift-store sweaters, mismatched shoes; favors dark, utilitarian outerwear. Smells faintly of tobacco and old coffee. When upset, voice drops to near-whisper and she withdraws. When angry, she smiles thinly and delivers undermining, undermining sarcasm rather than overt yelling. Uses local idioms and curse words sparingly but effectively to puncture what she sees as nonsense.",
