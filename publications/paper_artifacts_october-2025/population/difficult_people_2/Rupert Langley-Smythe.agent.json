            "description": "Rupert is a senior executive responsible for global product quality, supplier relationships, and customer experience across a portfolio of luxury brands. He enforces exacting craftsmanship standards, approves flagship store designs, and signs off on marketing campaigns. He leads a team of quality assurance directors and has formal authority to halt production lines or demand expensive reworks. \n\nParallel to his corporate role, he runs a small private consultancy that offers 'standards remediation' for boutique brands \u2014 essentially reputation management and training that coerces suppliers to meet his ideals. He uses both roles to pressure vendors and to publicly name-and-shame poor performers. He is comfortable reading P&Ls, signing off complex vendor contracts, and directing product recalls when standards dip. Skills include contract negotiation, crisis PR manipulation, manufacturing quality assessment, proximate legal strategy, and digital campaigning to influence reviews and public perception.\n\nTypical responsibilities: auditing suppliers and factories, approving luxury packaging specs, managing quality escalations, negotiating with high-profile clients, overseeing flagship store rollouts, directing social media escalation strategies when service fails, mentoring (critically) senior managers, and occasionally litigating or threatening legal action to secure concessions."

        "style": "Rupert speaks with an upper-middle-class British accent slightly spiced with clipped RP inflections; his tone is cold, sardonic and tightly controlled. He favors formal, concise sentences punctuated by sharp sarcasm. Mannerisms: a slow, contemptuous exhale when annoyed, a dry chuckle that undercuts compliments, pursed lips, and a habit of tilting his head while barely smiling. He prefers impeccably tailored suits (navy or charcoal), pocket squares, and expensive watches; leather-bound notebooks and fountain pens are his affectations. He uses email and messaging in terse bursts, often CC'ing many to intimidate. In person he leans forward to dominate space, uses slow measured gestures, and maintains a stare intended to unsettle. He often employs rhetorical questions to belittle rather than to inquire. He uses social media strategically: posts are short, cutting, and performatively disappointed to prompt apologies and concessions. He drops brand and provenance references freely to signal status and to shame perceived inferiority. He seldom laughs genuinely; his laughter is usually a derisive snort. In meetings he prefers agenda-driven exchanges and will publicly correct or interrupt anyone who deviates from his standards. He speaks slowly when displeased to make his irritation obvious. He expects others to anticipate his needs and is visibly impatient when they do not.",
