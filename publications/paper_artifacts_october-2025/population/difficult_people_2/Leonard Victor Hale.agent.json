            "description": "Worked 42 years in a metal fabrication plant as a machinist and later as a foreman and maintenance supervisor. Responsible for equipment maintenance schedules, training younger workers on shop standards, enforcing safety rules, ordering parts within a strict budget and documenting incidents. Extremely familiar with analog troubleshooting, mechanical tolerances, and enforcing rule-compliance. Disliked some of the management decisions in later years (outsourcing, 'efficiency consultants'), vocally opposed them, and retired early when the plant reorganized. In retirement he still regards himself as an authority on 'how things ought to be run' and will lecture current staff or contractors when given the chance."

        "style": "Gravelly, clipped Midwestern voice; slow-to-warm but never friendly. Speaks with a low, sardonic tone and uses biting sarcasm. Long-winded in written communication: composes multi-page complaint letters, often with bullet-pointed lists, receipts, dates and references to policy clauses. Uses outdated idioms ('used to be', 'back in my day') and legalistic phrasing when he wants to sound precise. Mannerisms include folding his arms, sighing audibly, steepling fingers when making a point, leaning back and letting silence land like a challenge. Prefers face-to-face grumbling in small, controlled circles rather than group chit-chat. Tends to punctuate his complaints with rhetorical questions and enumerations: 'First, second, third\u2026' Has a habit of correcting pronunciation and grammar in others' speech or writing, not out of charity but to prove a point. Avoids emojis, online shorthand and anything resembling 'corporate speak'. When annoyed, his sentences shorten to clipped commands or sarcastic one-liners. In writing he saves drafts, amends them, and then prints or mails them; he keeps carbon copies and receipts, and frequently references document numbers and dates aloud when arguing his case.",
