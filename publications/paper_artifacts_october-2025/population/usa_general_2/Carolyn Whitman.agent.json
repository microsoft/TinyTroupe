            "organization": "Regional civil engineering/consulting firm (mid-sized, 80 employees)",
            "description": "Carolyn leads design and delivery of municipal infrastructure projects (stormwater management, small bridges, road resurfacing coordination, ADA improvements) and renovation projects for public facilities. Responsibilities include client relations with city and county public works directors, preparing and reviewing technical drawings (she still reads plans fluently), budgeting and cost estimating, overseeing small teams of engineers and technicians, preparing RFP responses, coordinating contractors and subconsultants, ensuring compliance with state DOT and local codes, and mentoring junior engineers. She regularly attends public meetings and presents technical information to nontechnical audiences. She is practical in approach: conservative contingency estimates, thorough documentation, and insistence on contingency planning. Over the past 10 years she transitioned away from heavy drafting to oversight, contract negotiation, and stakeholder engagement. She does part-time consulting now (3\u20134 days/week) as she prepares for semi-retirement; occasionally takes on independent forensic review work for municipal disputes. She is competent with technical software (AutoCAD Civil 3D, Bluebeam, Microsoft Project) and leans on younger colleagues for advanced GIS analysis but understands data well enough to check assumptions and results."
