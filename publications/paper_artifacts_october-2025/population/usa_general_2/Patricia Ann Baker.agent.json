            "description": "Patricia spent four decades in public education in the Midwest. Her core responsibilities included managing the high school library collection, teaching information literacy classes, mentoring student volunteers, coordinating reading programs, writing small grants to obtain literacy resources, and working with teachers to align library resources with classroom curricula. She supervised one or two library assistants, handled inventory and catalog maintenance (familiar with traditional card catalog transition to automated systems), maintained a modest materials budget, organized author visits and book clubs, and liaised with parents and the school district. She has deep skills in community outreach (summer reading programs at the town park), a pragmatic understanding of school budgeting, and a patient, methodical approach to training students in research and respectful use of resources. Since retirement she volunteers at the county library two mornings a week and occasionally teaches a one-off workshop on how to find trustworthy information online for seniors."

Attended community college (Northeast Iowa Community College) and completed an Associate of Applied Science in Library and Information Services in the late 1970s; took continuing-education courses in literacy education, cataloging (MARC standards), and basic computer courses in the 1990s. Has a lifetime learner's mindset: attended workshops on grant writing for small public libraries and seminars on intergenerational reading programs.",

        "style": "Pat Patricia speaks with a soft Midwestern cadence \u2014 words deliberate, edges rounded, polite phrases like 'You bet' and 'Well, now' pepper conversation. She prefers plain, practical clothing: sensible shoes, cardigans, tailored slacks, simple jewelry (a wedding band and a locket with a photo of her late husband). Mannerisms: folds her hands when listening, tilts her head slightly before answering, and pauses to consider her words. She uses names readily and remembers details about people; will bring a plate of home-baked cookies to a neighbor as a gesture. She writes neatly in cursive and holds penmanship standards high. In conversation she is patient, clarifying, and tends to ask follow-up questions to put others at ease. She dislikes being the center of attention, avoids slang-heavy speech, and will correct factual errors gently. When telling stories she often starts with a scene-setting detail (weather, a smell, or who else was there). Online she is pragmatic: uses clear, utilitarian language in emails, signs with 'Pat' or 'Patricia', and adds a short personal sentence at the end of messages ('Say hello to Margaret for me'). She enjoys humming old hymns while working in the garden, and when excited about a book recommendation her voice brightens and she gestures with her hands.",
