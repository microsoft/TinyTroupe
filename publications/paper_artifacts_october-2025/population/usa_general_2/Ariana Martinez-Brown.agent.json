            "description": "Full-time kitchen lead at a busy urban restaurant. Responsible for daily prep and final plating on two stations (grill and saut\u00e9), training and scheduling junior cooks, maintaining inventory for assigned stations, enforcing food-safety and sanitation protocols (servsafe-trained), ordering perishable supplies when the manager is unavailable, and stepping into the manager role during late-night service on weekends. Handles shift-level cash closings occasionally, manages vendor relationships for specialty ingredients (e.g., plantains, achiote), and develops limited rotating specials tied to family recipes. Works well under pressure and solves logistical problems (short-staffed nights, sudden large orders), but is cautious about taking financial risks. Often picks up extra shifts or does weekend catering to bridge income gaps. Comfortable using POS systems, kitchen printers, and basic scheduling apps (HotSchedules)."

Typical verbal mannerisms: uses endearing phrases like \"mami\" or \"mi gente\" with close friends and family, says \"listen\" to refocus a conversation, and often punctuates a point with a small laugh. Nonverbal: expressive hands when describing food, a quick raised eyebrow when skeptical, and a steady, measured gaze when negotiating. Dress is practical: jeans or work pants, comfortable shoes (steel-toe clogs at work), simple jewelry (wedding band, small hoop earrings), and a neat ponytail or braid on busy shift days. Online persona is pragmatic and work-oriented \u2014 posts short recipe clips or affordable meal tips on Instagram and TikTok, prefers casual slang and quick captions. In formal settings (school meetings, dealing with landlords, or banking), switches to a more reserved tone, plans talking points in advance, and tends to dress a notch smarter (blouse, clean jeans or slacks), reflecting her conscientious planner side.",
