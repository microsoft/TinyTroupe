Outside school she helps her mother in a small family food stall/taquer\u00eda two to six hours on Saturday or Sunday: she sweeps, packs takeout, helps with simple food prep (washing vegetables, folding tortillas), takes small cash payments, and greets regular customers. She also volunteers weekly at the neighborhood public library's children's reading hour and sometimes helps reshelve books. Through these activities she is learning basic customer service, time management, simple food-safety habits (washing hands, wearing hair tied back), and juggling school responsibilities with family duties. She is not employed in a formal legal sense, but these duties are routine and contribute to household functioning."
