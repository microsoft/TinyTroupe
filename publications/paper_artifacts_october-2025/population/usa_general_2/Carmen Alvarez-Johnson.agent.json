            "organization": "Eastside Community Health Center (public-affiliated clinic) and neighborhood nonprofit outreach program",
            "description": "Carmen works roughly 28-32 hours per week across two linked roles: as an LPN in the clinic (triage, basic wound care, vitals, medication education) and as an outreach coordinator for a nonprofit that organizes health fairs, vaccination drives, and chronic disease education workshops in the surrounding neighborhoods. Her responsibilities include: staffing weekly chronic disease group visits (diabetes/hypertension), conducting home-visit follow-ups for high-risk patients, coordinating volunteer schedules, arranging transportation to specialty appointments for uninsured clients, collecting and reporting basic program metrics to grant managers, and training community health workers in culturally competent communication. She often mediates between patients and the clinic's social worker for housing and benefits referrals. Skills used daily: basic nursing procedures, motivational interviewing, bilingual Spanish-English communication, community organizing, scheduling, basic Excel/data-entry for program metrics, arranging small budgets for supplies, and grant-reporting narrative notes. She formerly worked full-time as an LPN in a hospital setting in the 1990s and 2000s and shifted toward community-based work a decade ago to reduce nights and provide more family-friendly hours. She's familiar with Medicaid/Medicare enrollment basics and common clinic workflows. She has difficulty with complex electronic health records but is competent at the specific local systems she uses daily."
