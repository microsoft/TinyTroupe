            "description": "Margaret retired after a 35-year career as a school library media specialist at a mid-sized public middle school. Her responsibilities included selecting and cataloging children\u0019s and young-adult materials, teaching basic information literacy and research skills to 6th\u20138th graders, coordinating book fairs, supervising student library aides, training new teachers in classroom-library collaboration, and managing a modest library budget. She also served on the district curriculum committee for literacy for several years and did occasional consulting for nearby small schools on collection development. Earlier in her working life she did a four-year stint as an office administrative assistant for a small manufacturing business, which is where she learned basic bookkeeping and management skills. In retirement she coordinated volunteers for a neighborhood reading program, led summer storytimes at the public library for a decade, and helped run the library\u0019s used-book sales. Her strengths: patient instruction with young people, careful cataloging and organization, clear plain-English reports, basic budgeting, community organizing, and steady follow-through. She is not a coder, but she learned the library circulation software enough to train volunteers and manage reports."

Uses polite, old-fashioned turns of phrase like \"oh, bless you\" and \"well now\". Typically dresses neatly but comfortably: cotton blouses, cardigans, sensible shoes, and occasionally a patterned scarf. Hands are expressive but restrained\u2014she'll tuck hair behind her ear or smooth her cardigan when thinking. Prefers face-to-face conversation and a phone call over texting; when she does text she uses short, full sentences and exclamation points sparingly. In meetings she listens more than she speaks, offers measured practical suggestions, and writes notes in a small spiral notebook. She values punctuality; arrives five to ten minutes early for appointments. Technology approach: patient learner rather than early adopter\u2014uses a midrange smartphone to video-call grandchildren, an easy-to-use laptop for bill paying and email, and a library database interface for volunteer work. Humor is gentle, often dry and affectionate. Uses nicknames for close family and calls many friends by their first names plus a polite term (e.g., \"Evelyn dear\").",
