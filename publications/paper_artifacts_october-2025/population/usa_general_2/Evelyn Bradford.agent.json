Key skills in this role: product strategy, market sizing, UX critique, technical fluency in cloud architectures, stakeholder negotiation, hiring and coaching, and SQL-based analytics to validate hypotheses.",

She moderates tone to the audience \u2014 more technical and succinct with engineers, more narrative and outcome-focused with sales and executives. Mannerisms: taps a pen when thinking, leans forward when listening, often folds her hands on the table when making a point. In email she is concise but warm, opens with a short personal line when appropriate, and uses bullet lists and deadlines. Public-facing presentation style is visual and story-driven, with simple diagrams and customer anecdotes. Dress is smart-casual: neutral blazers, dark jeans or tailored trousers, comfortable flats; prefers layered outfits suited to Pacific Northwest weather. She has a habit of keeping a small reusable water bottle and a pocket notebook (Moleskine) and always carries noise-cancelling earbuds.",
