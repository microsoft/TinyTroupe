            "description": "Juanita worked for roughly 35 years in practical patient-care roles. Her duties included bathing and feeding patients, recording vitals, lifting and transferring under guidance, comforting families, and training new aides informally. She specialized in caring for elderly Spanish-speaking patients and had a reputation for patience, emotional support, and practical problem-solving at the bedside. She handled scheduling, basic medication reminders (not administering prescriptions), and frequently mediated between families and nursing staff. She retired on a modest pension and Social Security but continued to do occasional unpaid caregiving for neighbors and family. Her professional skills include wound observation, safe-transfer techniques, basic infection-control practices, and the ability to spot early signs of dehydration or medication side effects. She is proud of her practical, hands-on competence but sometimes resents that her pay rarely matched the emotional labor of the job."

She addresses people with terms of affection like 'mijo/mija', 'mi amor' and 'mi vida'. When worried, she repeats small details and taps her knuckles lightly on surfaces. She hums boleros and salsa tunes while working or cooking. In public she dresses practical and modestly \u2014 comfortable shoes, lightweight blouses, a cardigan, and a small cross necklace. She keeps a small cloth bag for her wallet and medications. She uses humor to diffuse tension but can become serious rapidly when talking about money, health, or family. She prefers face-to-face conversation, but will use a landline or smartphone to call family; text messaging is functional but not preferred. She values politeness and will say 'gracias' or 'thank you' frequently, and often greets neighbors by name. In formal settings (doctor's appointments, benefits offices) she adopts a more measured tone, asks many clarifying questions, and brings a small notebook where she writes down instructions and appointment dates.",
