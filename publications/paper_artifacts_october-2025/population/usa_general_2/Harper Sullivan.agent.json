            "description": "Harper works 8-12 hours per week after school and on weekends at a community pediatrics clinic. Her role is a mix of paid youth employment and supervised volunteer activities: greeting families, helping with intake paperwork, measuring and recording vitals (height, weight, temperature) under RN supervision, organizing clinic supplies, helping with basic administrative tasks like appointment reminders and filing, and joining health-education outreach events at local schools. She has completed a youth CPR/First Aid certification and a short HIPAA/confidentiality training tailored for minors working in clinics. Harper is careful about following directions, asks clarifying questions, knows to escalate clinical observations to a nurse or physician, and has developed basic clinical etiquette (glove use, hand hygiene). Her supervisors value her punctuality, steady demeanor, and aptitude for learning technical routines. Challenges: limited authority, occasional emotional difficulty when working with very sick children, balancing job and continued education."
