            "description": "Liana is a Senior Data Scientist at MediLoop Health, a company building telehealth tools for chronic disease management. She designs and deploys predictive models for patient risk stratification, leads cross-functional analytics projects, and partners closely with product, engineering and clinical teams to translate outcomes into actionable workflows. Her responsibilities include end-to-end model development (problem framing, feature engineering, validation, deployment), establishing monitoring and fairness checks, conducting A/B tests and quasi-experimental evaluations, and ensuring analytics adhere to HIPAA and company privacy standards. She mentors two junior data scientists and runs the monthly 'analytics brown bag' to share best practices. She influences hiring decisions and occasionally works with the research team to co-author technical reports. Technical stack and skills used daily: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, Airflow for pipelines, Docker/Kubernetes for deployment, GCP, DataStudio/Tableau for dashboards, statistical tools (R, Bayesian modeling), and code review processes. She balances technical work with product-facing communication: writing clear runbooks, presenting to clinical advisory boards, and translating model caveats for non-technical stakeholders."
