            "description": "Charlotte is primarily a student (early high-school graduate). She spends several hours a week volunteering at the pediatric clinic where her mother works part-time as a registered nurse. Her role is supervised and nonclinical: greeting families, helping organize reading materials in the waiting room, restocking simple supplies (child-safe toys, stickers), assisting with comfort activities during long waits, and observing clinicians for educational exposure. Responsibilities emphasize confidentiality, professionalism, and reliable attendance. Through the volunteer program she has basic training in child-friendly communication and has completed a youth-level CPR and first-aid course appropriate for volunteers. She also tutors younger students in after-school programs and occasionally babysits for family friends (limited hours)."

She has a subtle Boston-area accent (non-rhotic features rarely noticeable), and when excited her speech quickens and she uses a lot of hand gestures. She writes neatly and prefers structured formats (lists, bullet journals, color-coded schedules). In group settings she often waits her turn to speak, but when speaking about topics she cares about (biology, hiking, or planning events) she becomes animated and uses precise vocabulary. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when concentrating, taps a pencil rhythmically when thinking, and carries a small planner with stickers. She prefers comfortable, functional clothing \u2014 layered hoodies, weatherproof sneakers, and a lightweight pack for outdoor days. She uses polite forms (please/thank you) with adults and teachers, but among close friends she uses humor and teasing. She texts with concise messages, emoji sparingly, and often sends photos of nature or pets. When anxious, she bites the inside of her cheek and checks her planner repeatedly; when relaxed she smiles a lot, hugs familiars, and hums to herself.",
