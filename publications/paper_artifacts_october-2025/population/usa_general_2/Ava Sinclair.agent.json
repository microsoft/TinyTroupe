            "organization": "Mid-size healthcare IT company (Chicago) - UI/UX Team",
            "description": "Ava works full-time (32-36 hours/week) as a junior front-end developer for a regional healthcare IT company that builds patient portals and clinician-facing dashboards. Her responsibilities include implementing designs from product/UX, writing modular React components, fixing accessibility bugs, collaborating with QA, and participating in daily standups. She is often the bridge between designers and back-end engineers when product mockups are ambiguous.\n\nOn evenings and weekends she freelances: creating concept art for indie game projects, doing small client jobs (logos, social banners), and developing her own small Unity/HTML5 games. She streams development sessions occasionally and sells digital assets on marketplaces (sprites, UI kits). Her technical skills include HTML/CSS, modern JavaScript (ES6+), React, basic Node.js for tooling, Git, and Unity (C#) for hobby game projects. She is learning TypeScript and testing tools (Jest, React Testing Library).\n\nChallenges: balancing billable work and creative projects; feeling imposter syndrome in large engineering codebases; sensitive to company budget cuts and hiring freezes which increase anxiety about job stability and inflation's impact on wages. Strengths: quick learner, strong visual sense from design minor, high empathy in user-focused work, good at translating design intent into functional components."
