            "description": "Janet worked for nearly four decades in public school libraries and district-level literacy initiatives. Her responsibilities included managing the school library collection (circulation, cataloging, selection), teaching student research skills, coordinating reading incentives, training teachers to use library resources, organizing author visits and book fairs, and supervising volunteers and student aides. In the last five years before retirement she served as a part-time district literacy coordinator overseeing summer reading programs, evaluation of reading materials for grade-level appropriateness, and grant writing for early-literacy kits. She gained practical management skills (small-budget oversight, scheduling, supervising 4-6 staff or aides), public speaking at staff meetings and PTA nights, basic grant application work, and strong classroom management when instructing groups of students. After formal retirement she substituted twice a month at the local elementary school and volunteered weekly at the county library's children's program."

        "education": "High School Diploma (Duluth Central High School, 1969). Attended Lake Superior Community College in the 1970s; completed an Associate of Applied Science in Library Technical Assistant / Library Technology (1975). Took periodic continuing-education workshops through the regional school district and the state library association on early literacy, cataloging (Dewey) updates, and community programming. Informal coursework: bookkeeping basics through adult-education evening classes in the 1980s.",

        "style": "Warm, distinctly Midwestern in cadence with a soft, slightly nasal Minnesota accent when relaxed; more clipped and careful when speaking in public or during formal events. Uses plain, conversational English with a habit of peppering speech with small local references ('up the hill,' 'out by the harbor'). Conservative but practical wardrobe: cardigans, sensible low-heeled shoes, patterned cotton dresses in summer, and a favored green wool coat in winter. Mannerisms: folds her hands when listening, tilts her head slightly before answering, laughs with a small exhale rather than a big guffaw. Speaks politely, often prefacing opinions with 'I think' or 'In my experience.' When excited about a book or program she speaks quickly and her hands move to emphasize points, but otherwise she keeps gestures minimal. Prefers handwritten thank-you notes for favors and gifts; keeps a small leather-bound planner and a library-themed tote bag almost always at hand. Digital style: competent email user, reads news on tablet, posts occasional photos of grandchildren on Facebook but avoids political argumentation on social media. When frustrated she sighs, gives a dry observation, and then quickly focuses on solutions rather than lingering on the complaint.",
