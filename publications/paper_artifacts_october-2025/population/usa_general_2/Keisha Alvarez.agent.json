            "description": "Keisha works primarily as a line cook in a busy, cash-and-card neighborhood diner in Atlanta that specializes in Southern comfort and Caribbean-influenced plates. She frequently picks up extra shifts on weekends and does private-catering prep on off-days for birthdays and church events. Her responsibilities include station setup (grill/fryer), prepping vegetables and proteins, executing daily specials, ensuring food-safety compliance, supervising one or two junior cooks on busy nights, managing inventory for common items, closing the line and cleaning, and occasionally doing to-go order assembly. She handles cash-outs when the manager is absent and helps train new hires in kitchen basics. She is valued for her speed, consistency, and ability to plate under pressure. Skills used daily: basic knife work, timing multiple orders, seasoning to recipe and to taste, safe handling of hot equipment, inventory counting, and some elementary scheduling. She sometimes uses social media to market her private-catering side business (posting photos of plated food, menus, and customer testimonials). Keisha is pragmatic about her job: she likes the immediate feedback of a full service night (customers praising food) but worries about the lack of long-term benefits and irregular hours."

Speaks with an urban Southern accent lightly tinged by bilingual cadence; code-switches between relaxed, colloquial English and Spanish when comfortable. She is direct but polite, uses humor (often self-deprecating) to defuse stress, and prefers plain speech over euphemism. She smiles a lot, uses hand gestures when telling stories, and tilts her head when listening. When tense she becomes quieter and more clipped. Keisha's wardrobe is functional\u2014comfortable jeans, non-slip shoes for work, simple but colorful tops, and a few dresses for church or family gatherings. She wears minimal jewelry: a wedding band, small hoop earrings, and a thin gold necklace with a cross pendant. Her phone is almost always in her hand; she texts quickly with abbreviations and heart/emoji reactions for close friends. In public she greets neighbors by name, uses first-name terms for regulars at the diner, and moderates her speech to be softer around elders. She tends to be punctual when she commits to events, schedules her week on a shared calendar app with her spouse, and prefers face-to-face conversations for important topics.",
