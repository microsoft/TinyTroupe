            "description": "Eloise works as a junior front-end developer for a small digital agency that serves local businesses, non-profits, and arts organizations. Her primary responsibilities are building responsive interfaces in React, implementing accessible HTML/CSS patterns, debugging cross-browser issues, performing light UX research for client work, writing and maintaining component documentation, and deploying static sites via the agency's workflow (Netlify/deploy scripts). She also handles small freelance projects (portfolio microsites, event landing pages) on weekends. Typical day tasks: turn designs into components, troubleshoot layout issues, write semantic markup and ARIA labels, collaborate with a designer on micro-interactions, and communicate status to the project manager. Skills centrally used at work include: JavaScript (ES6+), React, CSS-in-JS and SASS, Git/GitHub, basic Node tooling, Chrome DevTools, accessibility testing tools (axe, Lighthouse), and basic SQL for small CMS data queries. She is learning TypeScript and serverless basics in her spare time. Eloise frequently tutors first-year students part-time through the university's tutoring program and volunteers at weekend coding meetups for teens."
