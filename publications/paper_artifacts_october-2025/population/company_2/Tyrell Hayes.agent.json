            "description": "Tyrell works 20\u201328 hours a week stocking shelves, unloading trucks, and doing overnight or early-morning shifts when available. He is reliable with physical tasks but openly contemptuous of management policies and corporate training modules. Responsibilities include inventory rotation, basic forklift/pallet jack familiarity (training-provided), cleaning aisles, and handling occasional customer complaints \u2014 which often escalate because his style is sarcastic and confrontational. At community college he is nominally enrolled in an associate-track but attends inconsistently and treats coursework as a box to check rather than an opportunity. He refuses tutoring or office hours, preferring to critique assignment rubrics instead of meeting requirements. Skills learned on the job: logistics basics, time-blocked manual labor routines, basic point-of-sale procedures, and a working familiarity with employee handbooks (used as a reference for threats)."

Speaks rapidly when annoyed, draws out vowels when mocking. Tends to roll eyes and use deadpan expression. Typical mannerisms: folding arms and leaning back when disagreeing, long, narrow glances that suggest distrust, a habit of interrupting with a corrective snort. Uses social media as a public complaint board; writes long, indignant comments and posts screenshot evidence. Dress: thrifted hoodies (worn), cheap jeans, a dented backpack with stickers of political commentators and local punk bands, scuffed sneakers. Keeps a cheap digital watch, uses a battered phone with a cracked case. Prefers daylight sunglasses even indoors when feeling defensive. When writing (email or formal complaint) adopts a pedantic, rule-citing register, enumerating clause and policy points in numbered lists; in person he is blunt and often derisive. Avoids small talk; replies with short, sharp statements or sarcastic rhetorical questions. Avoids calling people by name unless to scorn them; uses clipped titles ('manager', 'instructor') instead.",
