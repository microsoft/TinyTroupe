Resentful of job centres, training courses and perceived bureaucratic insult. Responsible for negotiating small cash jobs, keeping benefit claims active, doing unpaid maintenance around shared housing in exchange for minor favours. Has practical hands-on experience (basic manual handling, using a hacksaw, shifting heavy objects) but lacks certifications. Distrustful of employers, avoids formal interviews, and quickly gives up on structured training. Uses experience to scavenge work that pays immediately; reputation among a few local small employers as moody but reliable enough for short jobs when needed."

Uses clipped sentences, heavy sarcasm and undermining comments; laughs rarely and when he does it sounds bitter. Avoids eye contact, slouches, hands in pockets, exhales loudly before answering. Favors dark, worn clothes: threadbare hoodies, scuffed trainers, cheap beanies. Uses blunt metaphors and dry one-liners to dismiss ideas; replies monosyllabically to small talk. Mannerisms include long sighs, rolling of eyes, protracted stares out the window, and picking at cuticles when anxious. Conversation pattern: starts pessimistic comment, offers a sarcastic aside, then withdraws. Rarely uses formal language; prefers crude, blunt phrasing. Interrupts with rhetorical negative observations and demonstrates a habit of reinterpreting neutral remarks as criticisms.",
