            "description": "Experienced electrician with roughly 20 years in residential and light commercial wiring, service changes, troubleshooting, and repairs. Responsibilities include diagnosing electrical faults, completing code-compliant installations, mentoring less-experienced apprentices reluctantly, estimating labor, and maintaining his own basic set of tools. Skilled in reading blueprints, replacing service panels, running conduit, troubleshooting intermittent faults, and restoring power after storm damage. Expects high standards from other trades and frequently admonishes coworkers and subcontractors for perceived sloppiness. Often documents job issues with photos but rarely writes generous evaluations; prefers to get paid and move on. Keeps a tight budget; pushes back on material upgrades he deems unnecessary but will insist on using specific brands he trusts. Frequently complains to management about timelines and sloppy scheduling; this has led to occasional written warnings or small disputes but he's never been fired for incompetence."
