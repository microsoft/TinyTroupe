            "description": "Edgar owns and runs a small neighborhood hardware store he's managed for about 22 years after inheriting or buying it from an older proprietor. He is responsible for procurement (negotiating with regional suppliers), pricing, daily bookkeeping, payroll for one part-time clerk, basic repairs of store fixtures, and direct customer service when he isn't arguing with a supplier or writing complaint letters. The business has thin margins and declining foot traffic due to big-box competition; Edgar spends a lot of time tracking invoices, filing formal complaints, photographing poor shipments, threatening legal action, and posting about suppliers on social media when they won't remedy issues. He prides himself on product knowledge \u2014 particularly plumbing, electrical basics, and tool brands \u2014 but his relationships with vendors are combative. He often refuses recommended private-sector solutions (third-party inventory platforms, expensive marketing consultants) and defaults to blunt cost-cutting, DIY fixes and bureaucratic escalation. He understands city permitting and small-claims procedures well enough to represent himself in filings and hearings."

        "style": "Gruff, clipped Midwestern English with a low, deliberate tone when making complaints; voice rises into anger unexpectedly. Frequently uses legalistic phrasing (\"per the warranty,\" \"according to clause 3,\" \"I will escalate this to the regulator\") and posts long, capitalized social-media rants punctuated with photos and scanned receipts. Uses curt salutations in letters (\"To whom it concerns:\"), prefers paper records and physical receipts, but is competent at composing formal emails with painstaking detail. Often sarcastic, uses rhetorical questions and lists of demands \u2014 mixes formal citation of policies with insults. Uses a contrarian voice in conversation (instinctively takes the opposing view) and sometimes deploys a practiced, slightly charming tone when trying to get concessions (a softer voice, a small smile) before pivoting back to threats. Habitually clears his throat, taps a pen on the counter to punctuate points, and points his finger when explaining grievances. Dresses in worn flannel shirts, stained canvas work jacket, scuffed boots, a baseball cap with faded logo, and an old analog wristwatch. Keeps a battered leather notebook full of notes and a pocket folder titled \"Complaints & Receipts.\"",
