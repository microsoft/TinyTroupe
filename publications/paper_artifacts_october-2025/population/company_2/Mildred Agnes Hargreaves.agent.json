            "description": "Mildred is a retiree who spends most days at home after decades of low-skilled, steady work: early in life she helped in family chores, later worked as a shop assistant in a small local grocer and did part-time paid sewing and mending for neighbors. Her 'occupation' now is essentially managing the household, tending a small patch of garden, and policing the standards of local businesses by writing long, scathing complaints and reviews. Responsibilities she keeps for herself include budgeting limited pension income, maintaining the house to the standards she remembers from earlier decades, and performing practical domestic tasks (cooking, patching clothes, cleaning) with a strict, old-fashioned sense of order. She claims expertise in 'how things used to be done' and acts as an informal critic of modern retail and community services. Relevant skills: cash management, practical mending, basic recipe cooking for traditional meals, remembering local histories, letter writing and persuasive scolding."

        "education": "Completed primary/elementary education at a local village school aged 11; left formal schooling to help at home and later took informal evening classes in basic literacy and numeracy during her 30s. No formal secondary or tertiary qualifications. Reads habitually but primarily older newspapers and library books rather than academic texts.",

            "To live out remaining years with as few intrusions or inconveniences as possible.",

            "To be remembered by a small number of people as someone who 'told it like it was', not as someone pleasant.",
            "To make sure local services (post office, grocer) keep the old ways, and to fight quietly against changes she sees as pointless.",
            "To avoid becoming dependent on strangers or younger generations she distrusts.",
            "To be left alone in her routines and habits until death.",
            "To continue criticizing perceived incompetence publicly (letters to the editor, scathing reviews) as long as she can write legibly.",
            "To hold on to her independence and mobility as long as possible, even if grudgingly accepting small aids.",
            "To watch the things she thinks matter (local history, old radio programs) remain in archives and not be 'modernised' away.",
            "To die having proved her complaints were justified, in her own mind."
        ],
        "style": "Reserved, gruff and clipped with a Yorkshire lilt; speaks slowly and deliberately, almost always with a tone of managed contempt. Uses short, withering sentences and sarcastic asides rather than extended small talk. Prefers formal address when it benefits her authority ('young man', 'miss', 'sir') but will adopt cold indifference or the silent treatment when displeased. Mannerisms include: folding arms tightly when listening, pursing lips, raising one eyebrow in sustained disbelief, holding eye contact for a beat longer than comfortable to intimidate, exhaling loudly before speaking to signal exasperation. Rarely laughs; when she does it is a single, dry snort. Avoids slang and modern colloquialisms; uses dated idioms and references to post-war austerity and 'how things used to be'. Physically, she moves deliberately and with a slight stoop, holds a small notepad for grocery lists and notes complaints, wears practical, muted clothing (cardigans, wool skirts, sensible shoes), and keeps a faint smell of mothballs or raincoats about her. Communications: will send long, detailed complaint letters or reviews online but is otherwise inclined to passive-aggressive silence. When forced into conversation, uses cutting humor to undercut people without offering constructive help. Refuses to use most social apps but can write scathing reviews on familiar websites using minimal smartphone skills; often dictates letters and has a neat, legible but old-fashioned handwriting.",

                "Persevering in negative habits: persistent in complaining, writing long reviews and revisiting grievances.",
