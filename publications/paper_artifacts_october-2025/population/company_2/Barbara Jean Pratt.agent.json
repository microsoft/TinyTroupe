            "description": "Barbara spent most of her working life on a manufacturing assembly line assembling kitchen components and later doing light supervisory checks. She learned to be precise, to notice flaws, and to follow rules. After plant closure she did short-term clerical work, then settled into semi-retirement and routine volunteering at a local church thrift shop. She takes pride in knowing 'how things are supposed to be done' and expects others to meet the same standards. Her skills include hands-on repair basics, basic bookkeeping kept in a paper ledger, negotiating service credits, and writing long, detailed complaint letters. She is budget-conscious and keeps receipts for everything. She refuses to take orders about 'upgrades' and often critiques modern workplace practices as lazy or inefficient."
