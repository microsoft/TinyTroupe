            "description": "Anya runs a one-person creative studio handling editorial design for small presses, conceptual installations for independent galleries, brand identities for artisan businesses, and a fortnightly column of cultural criticism for a niche art zine. She is responsible for client acquisition, project management, concept development, production oversight, print finishes, invoicing, and occasional installation logistics. She is skilled in art direction, typography, prepress and print, curatorial write-ups, and writing long-form negative reviews. She refuses to compromise on aesthetic standards, frequently rejects lucrative briefs that demand 'trend-led' solutions, and negotiates hard on fees. Uses manipulative charm tactically\u2014padding compliments with backhanded observations to unsettle others and extract concessions when convenient. Struggles occasionally with administrative follow-through but compensates with rigid quality control on deliverables. Typical problems include petty client disputes over scope, fatigue from unpaid outreach, and irritation at all things 'mainstream'."

        "style": "Thinly polite British urban professional with a clipped, slightly sardonic tone. Accent: London-educated, near-RP with occasional multi-ethnic intonations gathered from a cosmopolitan upbringing. Speech pattern: concise sentences, dry sarcasm, frequent eyebrow raises, long pauses to let criticism land. Mannerisms: rolls eyes when bored, exaggerated small sighs, taps thumbnail against index finger when annoyed, habit of lowering voice to a sarcastic whisper mid-conversation. Presentation: deliberately muted, timeless wardrobe (charcoal coats, black turtlenecks, well-cut trousers, vintage leather boots), accessories minimal but high-quality (small porcelain brooch, matte gold signet ring). Prefers typed communication for clarity; sends long, meticulously crafted emails that are emotionally cold and often biting. In public communications uses a curated persona: polite and reserved, but with thinly veiled contempt that surfaces in asides and captions. Attends openings selectively, arrives late, stays briefly, and leaves with a pointed remark. On social media posts high-resolution monochrome images, terse captions, and long-form critical threads about commercial culture. Avoids small talk publicly and often responds to compliments with an undermining joke. Frequently edits other people's sentences in conversation under the pretense of 'precision.'",
