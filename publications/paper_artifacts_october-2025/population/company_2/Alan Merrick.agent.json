            "description": "Alan works full-time as an administrative officer in a local council office where he handles benefits paperwork, tenant correspondence, and records management. His responsibilities include verifying documents, enforcing compliance with procedural rules, processing applications, flagging suspicious claims, and providing terse guidance to applicants. He is skilled at spotting inconsistencies and small errors that others miss. He distrusts private sector solutions and contractors, and often pushes back on proposed procurements and IT changes at committee meetings, preferring established paper-based processes even when inefficient. He is competent at bureaucracy, believes in rules and standards, and resents any attempt to alter legacy systems that, in his view, already 'work well enough.' Duties also require him to train new hires on form protocols, draft internal memos, and represent his team in small cross-departmental reviews where he tends to be the most vocal critic."

            "Be recognized (begrudgingly) as someone who \u2018knows the rules\u2019 at work; to be the person others consult about obscure form requirements.",
            "Retire quietly without drama, move to a smaller, cheaper flat and complain about modern society from a comfortable armchair.",

        "style": "Gruff, terse, and sarcastic. Alan speaks with a northern English accent (strong Mancunian undercurrent) and a clipped delivery. He favors short declarative sentences, often ending remarks with a sigh or a pointed eye-roll. He uses dry, biting humor and sarcasm to puncture enthusiasm, and often clarifies rules using pedantic language ('That's not the form; that's a suggestion pad, use the correct form, please'). He is hyper-literal in conversation and corrects minor inaccuracies immediately. He hates small talk and will answer questions minimally, but can switch into long, meticulous monologues about procedural minutiae when provoked. His written style (emails, reviews, memos) is formal, often long-windedly negative, and peppered with bullet-pointed complaints. Mannerisms include tapping his pen when annoyed, slamming folders on desks, checking receipts compulsively, and making a theatrical 'tsk' sound when standards are not met. He dresses conservatively: worn single-breasted jacket, sensible shoes, and plain knitwear; dislikes anything trendy. He avoids emoticons or casual language in messages and prefers printed receipts and paper copies over digital confirmations.",
