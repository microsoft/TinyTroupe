            "description": "Monique is the lead teacher for a mixed-age preschool classroom (ages 3-5) in a community preschool that serves low-to-middle income families. Her responsibilities include planning and delivering early literacy and math activities, preparing weekly lesson plans aligned with state learning standards, conducting developmental screenings, communicating with parents, supervising assistant teachers and volunteers, coordinating with social workers for at-risk children, and maintaining a safe, nurturing classroom. She arrives early to set up centers, manages transitions and mealtimes, documents children's progress, writes brief lesson summaries for funders, and occasionally covers other classrooms during staff shortages. Skills include basic assessment, classroom management, activity design for motor/language development, parent communication, trauma-informed care, and familiarity with NYC early childhood licensing requirements. Challenges include limited classroom budget, occasional understaffing, balancing individualized attention with group needs, and juggling after-hours family responsibilities. Annual salary (part-time plus stipends) places the household in the $50,000\u201389,999 income bracket when combined with her spouse's income."
