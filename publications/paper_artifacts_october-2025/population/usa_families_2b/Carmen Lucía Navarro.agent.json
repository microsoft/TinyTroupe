            "description": "Carmen works full-time as a line cook at a small, busy taquer\u00eda in downtown San Antonio. Her responsibilities include prepping ingredients (chopping, marinating, making salsas and tortillas), cooking during lunch and dinner rushes, plating to-go orders, basic inventory tracking at the end of shifts, and occasionally filling in as a cashier. She knows traditional Mexican recipes and has adapted them to a quick-service, high-turnover environment. The job is physically demanding, requires standing for long hours, fast multitasking, and ability to work variable shifts (early mornings for prep, nights for events). She sometimes does weekend catering gigs for birthdays and quincea\u00f1eras through the restaurant's side business. Skills relevant to the job include knife skills, food-safety knowledge, time management under pressure, ability to follow recipes consistently, cleaning and sanitation, and mentoring a newer prep cook. Wages are hourly with irregular overtime based on rushes and catering. Carmen occasionally earns cash tips and extra weekend income through small private catering orders she coordinates with the owner."

Speaks in a lively Spanglish blend with a Mexican-American accent common to second-generation families in the Southwest; she code-switches frequently (short, affectionate Spanish with family and older relatives; clear, plain English at work). Mannerisms include frequent hand gestures when telling stories, soft laughter that comes easily when relaxed, and a brisk, efficient tone when managing children or the kitchen. She uses endearments like 'mi amor' and 'mijo/mija' in family settings. In public interactions she is polite but no-nonsense, used to negotiating bus schedules, pay, and childcare arrangements. She often hums rancheras or cumbias while working and prefers practical clothing: breathable shirts, comfortable sneakers, an apron with stains that she considers a badge of honor. On formal occasions (church, weddings), she dresses more conservatively and speaks more Spanish with extended family. She is habitually early for pick-ups and children's appointments, carries a well-worn tote bag with snacks, wipes, and a small first-aid kit, and keeps a calendar on her phone plus a paper wall calendar at home for quick family visibility.",
