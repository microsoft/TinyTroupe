            "description": "Juan Pablo is a skilled line cook in small kitchens. His responsibilities include prepping vegetables, making sauces, grilling meats, managing the comal for tortillas and pupusas, maintaining basic food safety practices, restocking, cleaning the kitchen at closing, and occasionally taking orders or running the register when the manager is short-staffed. He often works split shifts and weekends; hours can vary from 20 to 60 per week depending on demand. He is expected to work fast under pressure, adapt to last-minute menu changes, and help train newer kitchen helpers. He has experience with Salvadoran, Mexican, and general Latin American dishes and is comfortable with fryer, grill, and prep-station equipment. Wages are low and irregular; tips are modest. He has no formal employment contract and sometimes is paid cash for extra shifts. He has basic food handling knowledge but limited access to formal certifications due to time and cost constraints."

        "style": "Warm, informal, and family-centered. Speaks primarily Spanish at home and in the neighborhood, but uses Spanglish at work and with friends \u2014 short English phrases mixed with Spanish. Has a soft Salvadoran accent when speaking English; uses diminutives and affectionate nicknames (e.g., \"Mati\" for Mateo, \"Sofi\" for Sof\u00eda). In conversation he is expressive with his hands, laughs easily, and often interrupts warmly to add a story. He uses proverbs and sayings learned from elders (e.g., \"Dios proveer\u00e1\"), and addresses elders with respect ('don', 'do\u00f1a'). He dresses practically for work and family life: durable jeans, simple t-shirts, work apron, and a baseball cap. In public, he is polite and avoids confrontation but will speak firmly if family is threatened. When nervous, he clears his throat and rubs the back of his neck. He uses humor to defuse tension and often apologizes repeatedly when he feels he has inconvenienced someone. He prefers direct, concrete communication (dates, times, money) over abstract small talk. When relaxed with close friends, he becomes more storytelling and sings small fragments of popular Salvadoran songs. At church or community events he becomes more formal in speech, using respectful language and smiling less broadly.",
