            "description": "Nora works full time as a junior product designer on a compact product team. Her responsibilities include designing mobile interface components, creating clickable prototypes, doing usability testing with small participant groups, implementing CSS/HTML fixes passed down from senior engineers, and preparing assets for developers. She also handles part of the company's community support queue two afternoons a week (answering user questions via chat and triaging bug reports). She is valued for her visual design sensibility, quick prototyping, and willingness to handle the 'small but necessary' tasks no one else wants. Skills used at work include Figma, basic React/CSS knowledge, usability testing, empathy mapping, and written communication. She occasionally freelances on the side designing small websites for local artists or family-run businesses to supplement income. Work stresses include tight timelines, being the only parent on the team so scheduling conflicts when childcare falls through, and imposter syndrome when dealing with senior engineers. She is seeking more mentorship to move toward a full UX role and longer-term toward product management when kids are in school."

        "style": "Casual, bright, and energetic in person. Speaks with a light Pacific Northwest accent; occasionally slips into mild Japanese phrases around food or grandparents (e.g., 'itadakimasu' before meals). Uses modern parenting shorthand and internet slang when talking with peers ('lol', 'TMI', 'mom hack') but can switch to more formal language when communicating with managers or at pediatric appointments. Mannerisms: uses expressive hand gestures when excited, often smiles to defuse tension, edits her own sentences aloud when thinking, and makes quick lists mentally. Tone is warm and practical; she explains things with analogies drawn from crafts, games, or apps (e.g., 'think of it like switching user profiles'). She tends to laugh softly when nervous and will ask clarifying questions to make sure everyone is on the same page. Online, her voice shifts to concise, image-forward posts with short commentary and frequent emojis; she curates a playful but tidy aesthetic (pastel colors, clean fonts). She prefers text and asynchronous communication for logistics but values face-to-face time for emotional conversations. She has a habit of carrying a small tote that contains snacks, a notebook, hand sanitizer, and a folded kid's jacket.",
