            "description": "Yadira works about 22-28 hours per week as a cashier and stock assistant at a neighborhood supermarket. Her duties include ringing customers up, helping bag groceries, stocking shelves overnight when scheduled, cleaning aisles, assisting Spanish-speaking customers, and covering for absent coworkers. She does not have stable full-time hours; scheduling fluctuates and she often picks up extra shifts when available. On weekends she cleans houses for two regular families and babysits for neighbors (usually children under 5) to make extra cash and sometimes trades babysitting for childcare help with her own children. Her work skills are practical: fast scanning, handling a register, basic stock rotation, and customer service in both Spanish and English. She has experience negotiating shift swaps, asking managers for specific days off for her family schedule, and she is careful with cash handling though not formally trained in accounting. Her primary difficulties are unpredictable hours, lack of benefits, and little opportunity for higher pay without completing GED or getting further certification."
