            "description": "Avery works full-time as a junior front-end developer focused on building accessible, mobile-first interfaces for educational web tools aimed at K\u20138 teachers. Responsibilities include implementing designs in React, writing semantic HTML/CSS, collaborating with designers and product managers, fixing bugs, writing basic unit tests, and improving accessibility (ARIA attributes, keyboard nav). She handles small feature tickets independently and pairs on larger ones. She provides feedback from a parent/teacher-user perspective during product discussions. Skills include HTML5, CSS (Flexbox/Grid), JavaScript (ES6+), React basics, Git workflow, and familiarity with Figma. She learned much on the job and via bootcamps; she occasionally mentors new hires and interns informally. Works hybrid: three days in the office downtown, two days remote. Main workplace challenges are balancing deep-focus time with frequent interruptions and negotiating part-time flexibility around childcare needs. Her manager is moderately supportive; promotion to mid-level requires demonstrated ownership of a feature area and mentoring others."
