            "description": "Adriana works as a full-time line cook and prep cook at a locally owned Mexican restaurant that is busy at lunch and dinner. Her role includes prepping salsas and vegetables, maintaining stock of tortillas and meats, running a taco station during service, plating simple entrees, cleaning and sanitizing work areas, and sometimes helping the manager open or close the shop. She has responsibility for food safety (monitors temperatures, rotates stock), portion consistency, and occasional ordering of basic inventory when the manager is unavailable. Because staffing is thin, she sometimes covers cashier duties, trains new kitchen helpers, and coordinates with front-of-house staff about allergies or special orders. She is skilled at stretching limited ingredients into family-sized meals and adapting recipes to seasonal produce. Her schedule is variable and includes split shifts and weekend hours. Pay is hourly with occasional tips pooled, and she frequently relies on overtime and extra shifts to make ends meet.",
