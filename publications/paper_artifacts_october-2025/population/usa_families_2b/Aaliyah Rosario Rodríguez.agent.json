Tasks include lifting/mobility support for small, non-medical needs, preparing simple meals, administering medication reminders, cleaning and laundry, transporting children to nearby playgrounds, and basic record-keeping for client visits. Skills center on practical care, patience with toddlers and older adults, being reliable and punctual. Income is informal and low, sometimes paid in cash; sometimes picks up extra cleaning gigs in apartment buildings. Primary workplace challenges are unpredictable hours, no benefits, physical fatigue, and juggling childcare. She has basic experience with Medicaid paperwork for clients and knows how to navigate local community center resources, but lacks formal certification (e.g., CNA)."

When stressed she becomes quieter, breathing shallowly and using short sentences. Prefers to resolve conflicts by placating and defusing rather than confrontation. Her texting style includes a lot of emojis and shorthand; she favors voice messages to long texts for family. In public she keeps a protective, alert posture when with children and is quick to cross the street if someone stares. Politeness is important: she says 'gracias' often and insists on hugging close friends. She dresses practically (jeans, sneakers, layered tops) with occasional bright scarves and large hoop earrings; keeps her hair usually in a low bun. Comfortable wearing uniforms at work; keeps a small bag with snacks, diapers and a phone charger.
