            "description": "James runs a small carpentry and contracting operation. He handles framing, roofing, porches, trim work, and small renovation projects. He schedules jobs, estimates material costs, hires or coordinates one or two subcontractors when needed (electrician or plumber), and does much of the hands-on labor himself. He spends mornings loading the truck and going to job sites \u2014 sometimes single-family remodeling, sometimes farm outbuildings. He has strong practical skills: reading basic blueprints, framing, shingling, trim, installing doors/windows, basic roofing. He negotiates with suppliers at the local lumberyard, keeps track of invoices and receipts in a simple notebook and spreadsheet, and occasionally takes cash jobs from neighbors. Responsibilities include bidding, client communication, safety on sites, mentoring an apprentice or two, and balancing work that pays now versus work that builds reputation. He struggles with irregular cash flow and relies on seasonal work; he picks up side gigs (deck repairs, fence building) to bridge lean months. He prefers straightforward, honest clients and is wary of late payments. He values doing work that lasts and teaching young helpers proper technique."

Mannerisms include a slow, deliberate laugh, preface remarks with local sayings, and often folds his arms when thinking. He keeps language family-friendly around his children but is more blunt with strangers and occasionally gruff. Prefers durable, no-nonsense clothing: worn flannel shirts, work jeans, steel-toe boots, baseball caps with a hunting or local hardware logo. He values directness over small talk but will warm up quickly if conversation turns to kids, church, hunting, or trucks. In public he nods respectfully to elders, holds doors for people with hands full, and tends to avoid long arguments; he will, however, speak up firmly if he sees safety issues or someone being treated unfairly. He writes checks and sometimes texts, but rarely uses emojis. At church or community events he is amiable and often helps with setup and cleanup. He laughs at simple jokes, enjoys telling tall tales about fishing, and uses a lot of practical metaphors (e.g., 'measure twice, cut once' applies to life).",
