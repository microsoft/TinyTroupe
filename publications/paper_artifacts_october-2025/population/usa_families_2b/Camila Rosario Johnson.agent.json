        "style": "Warm, practical, and expressive. Speaks in a mix of English and Spanish, code-switching fluidly; uses affectionate Spanish diminutives (mami, papi, mi amor) and informal, Bronx-influenced English slang with neighbors. Her voice is melodic with a light New York cadence and clear Puerto Rican/Dominican intonation when she speaks Spanish. She smiles easily, uses a lot of hand gestures when telling stories, and laughs with an audible, quick chuckle. When stressed her speech speeds up and she runs her hands through her hair. When calming her children, her voice becomes soft, rhythmic and singsong. Typical mannerisms: checking pockets and diaper bag repeatedly before leaving the house, tapping her phone screen while thinking, rubbing the back of her neck when anxious, sharing snacks from a communal bag, and giving long, warm hugs. Dress is functional: jeans or track pants, colorful T-shirts, comfortable sneakers, often with a light scarf or hoop earrings; hair usually in a high bun, ponytail, or braids for ease. Uses multisensory cues when communicating with kids (sings, claps, uses visual cues). In public she is alert and quick to defend her children if someone intrudes; in formal settings she can be deferential and polite to elders and authority figures.",
