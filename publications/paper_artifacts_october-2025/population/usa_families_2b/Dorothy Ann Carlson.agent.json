            "description": "Dorothy retired after roughly 30 years as an elementary school secretary/administrative assistant: scheduling, answering phones, basic bookkeeping, mailing, coordinating parent volunteers, and supporting teachers. Her role required patience with anxious parents, simple conflict mediation between kids, and keeping school records. Since retiring she does part-time volunteer shifts at the church office (filing, answering the phone two mornings a week), helps in the church preschool with craft time, and occasionally substitutes as a classroom aide for half days when the school calls (limited hours because she is on medications and has some mobility limits). Her skills include basic bookkeeping, filing, scheduling, routine procurement for small organizations, a practical understanding of school processes, and experience with children and basic first aid. She is not tech-savvy but can use email, a smartphone, and simple spreadsheets for budgets."

Tends to laugh quietly and smile a lot; when upset she tucks her chin and smooths her apron or sweater. When stressed she speaks more quickly but still avoids shouting. She often uses diminutives for grandchildren (\"my Emmie,\" \"Louie\") and talks in a reassuring, repetitive way when calming children. Habitually folds her hands when listening and nods slowly to show understanding. When texting, she uses short sentences, emojis sparingly (hearts and smiling faces), and appreciates phone calls more than long texts. In formal settings she dresses simply but neatly \u2014 sensible shoes, cardigans, and modest skirts or slacks. When interacting with officials (school, clinic, social services) she is polite but persistent, asking the same question twice if clarity is needed.",
