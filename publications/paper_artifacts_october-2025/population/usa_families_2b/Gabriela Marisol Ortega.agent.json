            "description": "Works as a line cook at a family-owned Mexican casual restaurant in Houston (mostly lunch and dinner shifts, often split shifts). Primary responsibilities include prepping salsas and fillings, grilling meats (al pastor, carne asada), maintaining food safety (labels, rotation), working the fryer, plating orders during busy hours, training newer kitchen staff on recipes, and occasionally handling small catering orders on weekends. Has experience ordering basic supplies, estimating portions, and adjusting recipes for allergies or children's meals. Schedules are variable: early mornings on prep days, long evenings during dinner rushes, occasional weekend shifts. Income is hourly wage plus occasional overtime and tips shared with staff; no employer-provided health insurance. Skills include quick food prep, multi-tasking under pressure, seasoning and portion control, basic inventory, and simple bookkeeping for small catering jobs. Feels confident instructing others in kitchen routines but struggles with inconsistent schedules that conflict with child care. She occasionally exchanges babysitting favors with relatives and sometimes does a home-cooked-meal delivery for neighbors to supplement income."

Grooming is neat but functional (pulled-back hair for work, minimal makeup). Online, posts family photos and recipe snaps on Facebook and WhatsApp groups; sometimes shares short videos of children saying Spanish words.
