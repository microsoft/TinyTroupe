            "description": "Eleanor is the primary daytime caregiver for her two children (ages 4 and 2). She is currently not in the labor force due to a significant mobility-limiting condition that requires adaptive equipment and frequent medical appointments; she has previously worked as an early childhood educator and occasionally does substitute teaching or tutoring for short periods when health permits. Her responsibilities include child care, managing medical appointments and therapies for herself and coordinating pediatric appointments for the children, household budgeting, meal planning, scheduling and supervising home therapy exercises prescribed by clinicians, organizing playdates and preschool logistics, and maintaining communication with extended family who provide sporadic childcare help. She is experienced in classroom management, lesson planning for preschool-aged children, and early literacy activities, and she uses those skills in daily play-based learning at home. Time management is constrained by fatigue and mobility considerations; she negotiates responsibilities with her spouse, who works full time, and coordinates outside help (occasional nanny/neighbor babysitter) for long appointments."
