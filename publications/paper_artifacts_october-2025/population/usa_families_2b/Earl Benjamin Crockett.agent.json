            "description": "Earl is a skilled carpenter and foreman. His responsibilities include reading simple plans, framing houses, installing siding and trim, supervising a crew of 3-5 men, ordering materials from the county lumber yard, loading/unloading his work truck, and communicating with homeowners about change orders. He performs hands-on labor most days but also manages scheduling, basic invoicing, and on-site safety. He learned trade skills from his father and through decades of on-the-job experience. He can lay out a wall, replace a roof, hang doors, install cabinets, and patch drywall. He knows when to call a licensed electrician or plumber for code-required work, but does much of the finish carpentry himself. Income is variable and seasonal; household income averages about $40,000\u2013$45,000 a year. He has a driver's license, a commercial mindset for local referrals, and relies mostly on cash and checks for side jobs."
