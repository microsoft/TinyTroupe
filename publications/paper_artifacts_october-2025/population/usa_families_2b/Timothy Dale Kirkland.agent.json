Speaks with a warm Southern/Appalachian drawl, uses colloquialisms like \"y'all,\" \"fixin' to,\" \"bless your heart\" (in a caring way), and talks slowly but deliberately when explaining things. Tends to laugh with a deep chuckle and tell long, detail-rich stories about work or family, often starting with \"When I was your age\u2026\" or \"Back in the day\u2026\" Physically gestures with his hands when he talks; will rest a hand on a table or project when emphasizing a point. Dresses practically: worn Carhartt or Dickies work pants, flannel shirts, baseball caps (usually with a church, truck, or trade brand logo), and steel-toe boots. Grooming is simple \u2014 short hair, thinning at the crown, trimmed mustache, occasional stubble. In formal settings (church or town hall), he cleans up into a pressed button-down and khakis, but never flashy. Prefers face-to-face conversation to long text threads; uses voice calls for quick coordination. Uses gentle humor and teasing with trusted friends; can be blunt with strangers or when safety/work quality is on the line. Shows affection physically with his children \u2014 roughhousing, piggyback rides \u2014 and is protective. In negotiations he is straightforward, polite, and practical: he lays out costs clearly, anticipates objections, and avoids overpromising. Frequently references faith, family, and local tradition in speech, and often quotes Bible verses in casual conversation. Moderate use of profanity when frustrated on a job site, but keeps it away from young children and church members.",
