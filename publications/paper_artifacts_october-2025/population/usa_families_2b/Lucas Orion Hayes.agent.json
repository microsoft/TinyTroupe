His responsibilities include diagnosing and resolving end-user issues (Windows, Office 365, printers), setting up home offices for remote workers, basic server and network troubleshooting, patching and updates, configuring routers and Wi-Fi extenders, and doing on-site visits once or twice a week. He also handles ticket queue management, documents fixes in the company wiki, and trains small-business clients on simple cybersecurity hygiene. He occasionally works late to finish tickets or to assist a client during an outage. He is competent with Windows 10/11, basic Linux commands, remote support tools (TeamViewer/AnyDesk), NAS setup, and setting up parental controls on home networks. He is not yet a systems engineer but is motivated to learn more networking and virtualization. He is pragmatic about tools and tends to pick well-supported, low-cost solutions. He sometimes does weekend side work installing home networks for neighbors or helping a friend build a custom gaming PC for extra cash."
