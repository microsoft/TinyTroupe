She occasionally substitutes at other tribal preschool sites. To make ends meet she works weekend evening shifts as a cashier at the small convenience store in town where she rings up groceries, manages the lottery terminal, cleans, and opens/closes the register. Responsibilities include child supervision, classroom safety, basic lesson activity facilitation, simple record-keeping (attendance, meal counts), and assisting with family outreach events. Skills used: patience, basic child development knowledge, infant/child first aid and CPR certification (current), practical classroom management, basic cash-handling, and bilingual communication (English and Navajo basics). Typical earnings are low \u2014 combined household income under $25,000/year \u2014 variable schedules, informal overtime, and reliance on tribal supports (food stamps, WIC, utility assistance)."

Uses child-centered talk (high-pitched, singsong) when with her kids; switches to a flat, matter-of-fact tone when discussing finances or housing. Common mannerisms: tucks hair behind ear when thinking, rubs knuckles on her forehead when tired, laughs with a short snort, uses hand gestures to mimic small actions when explaining step-by-step tasks. Wears comfortable, practical clothing (jeans, hoodies, boots) most days; favors bright traditional scarves or a small silver concho pin for community events. Prefers direct, concrete instructions over abstract small talk; values punctuality for school and clinic appointments but is forgiving when family emergencies occur. Social style is community-oriented: polite to strangers, deeply loyal to close kin, and quick to bring a dish to a communal meal. In text messages she uses short sentences, emojis sparingly (a heart or folded hands), and often sends photos of her children to family group chats.",
