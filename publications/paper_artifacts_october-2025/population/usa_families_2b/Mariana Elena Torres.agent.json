            "description": "Works as a full-time line cook and food preparer at a busy neighborhood taquer\u00eda. Primary responsibilities include prepping vegetables, marinating and grilling meats (al pastor, carne asada), assembling tacos and bowls during lunch rush, maintaining food-safety standards, and occasionally opening or closing the kitchen depending on the schedule. Skilled at knife work, timing multiple orders, and adapting recipes under pressure. The job pays hourly wages plus occasional overtime; schedules rotate and often include early mornings, late nights, and weekend shifts.
