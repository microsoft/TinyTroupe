            "description": "Erin works roughly 28\u201332 hours a week in a community-based preschool program for 3- to 5-year-olds as a lead paraprofessional, responsible for classroom routines, daily lesson facilitation, snack and nap supervision, parent communication for her group, basic developmental screenings, and coordinating field trips. She plans play-based activities that scaffold early literacy, social-emotional learning, and cultural inclusion (incorporating Korean stories and songs). She holds basic first aid/CPR and child safe-sleep and choking-prevention certifications.\n\nIn the late afternoons/evenings she does freelance front-end work: small business websites, Wordpress maintenance, basic responsive HTML/CSS, and accessibility tweaks. Most freelance clients are neighborhood small-business owners (bakeries, tutors, therapists) and occasional friends; she manages invoices, client communication, and small project timelines. She balances her workload to protect family time and is skilled at toggling between the hands-on, sensory preschool environment and focused laptop work. Her main challenges are unpredictable preschool coverage needs (sick days), lack of employer-provided maternity leave buffer, and keeping freelance income steady without overworking evenings."
