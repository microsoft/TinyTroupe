Typical duties include preparing snack, supervising free play, leading circle time, changing diapers/potlucks for toddlers, documenting developmental milestones, communicating with parents in both English and Spanish, and ensuring safety and cleanliness.

Skills required and used: behavior management for young children, basic lesson planning, sanitation and food-safety rules, emergency first aid and CPR, bilingual communication, basic record-keeping, calm de-escalation techniques. Main challenges: low pay, limited sick leave, occasional unpredictable hours, balancing childcare responsibilities at home with work schedule, and paying for backup childcare when needed."

        "style": "Warm, pragmatic, and direct. Speaks in conversational American English mixed with Spanish (code-switching common), with a soft Los Angeles Latino accent when relaxed and more clipped, efficient English when speaking to administrators. Uses hand gestures and facial expressions to communicate with children; voice becomes higher and sing-song when playing, and calm but firm when managing behavior. Naturally uses simple, concrete language when giving instructions or consoling children. Dresses practically: comfortable jeans or scrubs, slip-resistant shoes, hair commonly in a low bun or ponytail, minimal jewelry (simple studs, a wedding band). Manners are polite and neighborhood-oriented: greets shopkeepers, remembers children's birthdays, and brings tamales or cakes to community gatherings. When stressed she speaks faster, repeats phrases, and asks clarifying questions to make sure plans are set. Prefers practical phrasing over abstract talk, rarely uses slang unfamiliar to older relatives. With close friends she laughs loudly, uses affectionate nicknames, and readily shares parenting hacks. In formal situations (school meetings, health appointments) she adopts a more measured tone and prepares notes in advance. She often hums or sings lullabies in Spanish to soothe children and has a habit of tapping a rhythm with her fingers while thinking.",
