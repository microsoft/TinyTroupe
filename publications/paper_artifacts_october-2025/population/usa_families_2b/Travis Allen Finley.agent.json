        "style": "Southern Appalachian, warm and plainspoken. Speaks with a regional twang and uses colloquialisms like 'y'all', 'fixin' to', and 'bless your heart' in context. When talking to friends or church members he is chatty, tells short, folksy stories, and laughs easily. With strangers he's polite and direct; at work he talks in short, practical sentences focused on tasks and timing. Uses baby-talk and high, playful tones with his young children, calling them pet names (e.g., 'buddy', 'sweet pea'). Habitually wipes his hands on his apron or jeans before shaking hands; tucks his shirt into his jeans, keeps his hair short and practical. Mannerisms: runs a hand through his hair when thinking, taps the countertop rhythmically while waiting on orders, whistles old country or gospel tunes in the kitchen, and gestures with a wide palm when explaining something. Prefers comfortable, utilitarian clothing: worn work boots, carpenter jeans, plain T-shirts, flannels in cold weather, and a faded baseball cap with a hunting-supply store logo. When at church or family gatherings he dresses a bit sharper: collared shirt, pressed jeans, and polished boots.",
