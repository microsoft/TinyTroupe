            "description": "Sofia is a lead preschool teacher responsible for planning and implementing daily curriculum for a mixed-age preschool classroom (ages 2.5-5), supervising two assistant teachers, communicating with parents, conducting developmental screenings, and maintaining classroom safety and licensing compliance. She designs bilingual lesson plans (English/Spanish), integrates play-based and emergent curriculum, documents developmental progress, and coordinates with site administrators and special services when children need speech or behavioral supports. Her role requires classroom management, lesson planning, parent conferences, record-keeping, and occasional home visits for children adjusting to preschool. She is skilled at adapting activities for different developmental levels, greeting families in Spanish and English, and coaching parents on routines and school readiness strategies. Work challenges include balancing paperwork with classroom time, addressing occasional behavioral outbursts, and managing days when substitute staffing is limited. She frequently uses Google Classroom/teacher apps for parent communication, and occasionally runs parent workshops on potty training, sleep routines, and bilingual literacy."
