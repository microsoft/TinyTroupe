            "description": "Maya works as a freelance documentary filmmaker and video producer. Her responsibilities include concept development, shooting (DSLR/mirrorless), field audio capture, interviewing, basic lighting for small crews, editing in Adobe Premiere Pro, color correction, and client communications. She juggles multiple short-form commissions for nonprofits, local arts festivals, and a small regional media outlet. She writes proposals, negotiates day rates, manages small budgets ($1k-$8k typical per project), schedules shoots around family life, and occasionally mentors college interns. She frequently collaborates with a small network of fixed contractors (one sound recordist, one motion-graphics freelancer) and trades services with friends (e.g., babysitting swaps during a weekday shoot). Her career strengths: storytelling, empathy in interviews, visual framing, editing rhythm. Challenges: unpredictable income, too many administrative tasks, needing to find time for long-form personal projects.",
