            "description": "Latoya is a full-time medical assistant at a busy nonprofit community health clinic serving an ethnically diverse, low-to-moderate income urban population. Her responsibilities include rooming patients, taking vitals, performing phlebotomy, administering basic vaccinations and injections under supervision, maintaining patient charts in the EHR, scheduling follow-up appointments, assisting providers during exams, educating parents about pediatric milestones and immunizations, and coordinating referrals to social services. She often helps with walk-in pediatric visits and vaccine clinics. She is trusted by many patients for her calm manner and cultural affinity. She also helps new hires learn clinic workflow. Time management, multitasking, and patient-centered communication are core to her role. She sometimes fills in for front-desk duties on busy days. She knows basics of billing codes and Medicaid enrollment processes, and has training in trauma-informed care. Typical challenges: high patient volumes, limited staff, dealing with insurance/billing questions, balancing empathy with efficiency, and advocating for patients within a constrained budget environment.",

Prefers clear, plain language rather than medical jargon when talking to parents. Online style: active on Facebook and private neighborhood parenting groups; posts photos of family milestones and church events; messages are friendly but pragmatic.
