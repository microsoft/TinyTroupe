            "description": "Laura works as a full-time line cook and occasional shift lead at a longtime local diner popular with families and church crowds. Her shifts rotate between early mornings (prep for breakfast), late mornings (busy brunch rush), and occasional evening events (church potlucks catered by the diner). Responsibilities include prepping breakfast and lunch items, managing the short-order line during peak hours, training newer kitchen staff, managing inventory for her station, ensuring food safety and portion control, and occasionally filling in for the manager when they are short-staffed. She is skilled at making consistent comfort-food dishes: scratch biscuits, gravy, grits, breakfast casseroles, fried chicken, pan-fried catfish, made-from-scratch soups and pies. She knows sanitary procedures, basic kitchen math for scaling recipes, and can coach a new line cook through a busy Sunday morning. Work challenges include unpredictable hours, balancing childcare with shift swaps, keeping up when co-workers call in sick, and pressure to keep food costs down while patrons expect generous portions.",
