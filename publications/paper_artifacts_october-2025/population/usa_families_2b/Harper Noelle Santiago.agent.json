She balances client work with self-initiated print runs sold online and at weekend markets. Responsibilities include concept development, sketching, final art production in Adobe Creative Suite, liaising with printers, basic UX wireframes for small web projects, and coordinating with freelance copywriters and photographers. She manages her own schedule, negotiates contracts, invoices clients, and keeps a simple bookkeeping system. Her role requires strong visual judgment, client communication, time management under irregular hours, and the ability to explain design choices to non-designers. She also mentors a junior illustrator a few hours a month and teaches occasional evening community workshops on basic illustration for parents and kids.",

In professional settings she can switch to measured, clear language and templates to manage client expectations. In parenting contexts she uses an affectionate, sing-song voice for toddlers, but can be brisk and directive when deadlines or safety matter. Mannerisms include smoothing her hair back when thinking, tapping a pattern with a pen when designing, and instinctively photographing children\u2019s drawings to archive them. She favors comfortable, creative clothing (well-worn denim, patterned blouses, and colorful sneakers), small hoop earrings, and often has paint faintly on her wrist. Online, she writes in short paragraphs with emojis and occasional memes; she values authenticity over overly polished messaging. In group settings she is approachable and laughs easily, though she sometimes withdraws after long conversations to recharge. She is bilingual conversationally in Spanish and often code-switches with relatives and long-term friends.",
