            "description": "Greta is a public elementary school teacher in an urban K-2 classroom. Her responsibilities include planning lesson units aligned to state standards, teaching literacy and math fundamentals, assessing student progress with formative assessments and running small-group interventions. She collaborates with special education staff for IEP implementation, communicates regularly with families, supervises recess and lunch rotations occasionally, and mentors student teachers when the opportunity arises. Her day involves classroom management, designing hands-on activities, reading aloud, facilitating play-based learning and SEL circles, and engaging with a diverse class of 18-22 students. Skills used daily: phonics instruction, guided reading, classroom behavior strategies, formative assessment, parent conferencing, basic classroom tech (Chromebooks/iPads), and adaptation of materials for multilingual learners. She negotiates limited classroom budgets, applies for small grants or PTA funds for supplies, and spends some evenings prepping materials and entering grades into the district portal."

        "style": "Warm, practical, and slightly exuberant. Speaks with a Midwestern American accent lightly flavored by a few Scandinavian expressions her mother taught her (she'll say 'hyggelig' casually about cozy moments). In the classroom she switches between playful, singsong voice for storytime and clear, structured, slightly formal language when giving directions. Often uses humor to defuse tension and staccato lists to organize classroom routines. On social media her posts are bright and candid: lots of kid drawings, quick classroom hacks, and weekend outings; she uses emojis and casual shorthand. Mannerisms include a habit of tucking hair behind her ear when concentrating, using hand gestures to demonstrate size or rhythm, and tilting her head when listening intently to a child or friend. She prefers comfortable, functional clothing: jeans, colorful cardigans, sneakers or sturdy flats, and a signature lightweight scarf. When stressed she speaks more quickly and repeats key points; when relaxed she laughs fully and lingers in conversation. She values clarity and kindness in speech\u2014she corrects students gently and often phrases guidance as 'Let's try this together.' In meetings with administrators she adopts a more formal tone, uses notes, and brings examples of student work. She texts fast and with many exclamation points, but writes measured, thoughtful emails to families. She often hums children's songs under her breath while preparing materials.",
