He usually works on-site as a foreman, does hands-on framing and finish carpentry, and handles client estimates, supplier relationships, and scheduling. He employs one full-time helper and occasionally subcontracts plumbing or electrical work. Responsibilities include bidding jobs, buying materials at the regional lumberyard, supervising jobs for quality and safety, training his helper, keeping basic books and tax records, and doing weekend maintenance calls. Skills include blueprint reading, framing, trim work, basic roofing, lead contact with clients, and practical problem solving when plans change. He struggles with paperwork and prefers dealing with people and tools rather than spreadsheets; he pays an accountant for taxes. Income fluctuates seasonally; last year's household combined income with his wife working part-time was around $68,000."
