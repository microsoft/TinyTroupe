Tends to repeat key points when coordinating schedules to ensure everyone understands. Uses simple, clear sentences and often references dates and times precisely because of her clerical background. Dress is practical: layered knit sweaters, stretchy jeans, sensible shoes, and a favored cardigan with a small tear mended at the cuff. Carries a sturdy canvas tote with receipts, children's paperwork, snacks, and a knitting project. When stressed, she hums an old Irish tune and clicks her keys; she organizes lists on paper first, then enters them into a basic smartphone calendar (she prefers physical lists but uses technology when necessary). Polite but direct \u2014 will say what must be done, but frames it compassionately. In social situations uses conversational small talk about kids, weather, and church bake sales; in advocacy or official settings she can be firm and persistent, drawing on years of paperwork and civic experience.",
