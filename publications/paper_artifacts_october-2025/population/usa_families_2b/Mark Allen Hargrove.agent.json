            "title": "Maintenance Supervisor",
            "organization": "Midwest Metalworks, LLC (mid-sized sheet-metal fabrication plant)",
            "description": "Mark supervises a 6-person maintenance crew in a busy regional fabrication shop. He schedules preventive maintenance, diagnoses mechanical and electrical faults on production lines, organizes shutdowns for equipment overhaul, trains junior techs, liaises with production managers to prioritize repairs, and maintains parts inventories. His role requires hands-on mechanical skill (basic hydraulics, bearings, belt drives, conveyors), safety compliance (ensuring lockout/tagout and PPE usage), paperwork for work orders, and vendor relations for spare parts. He occasionally steps onto the night shift to troubleshoot urgent breakdowns. He is competent with paper-based maintenance logs and uses a basic CMMS (computerized maintenance management system) at work but prefers hands-on checks. Strengths include pragmatic problem solving, the ability to keep a calm demeanor during production stoppages, and an aptitude for teaching apprentices. Pain points include paper bureaucracy, inconsistent staffing, and pressure from management to cut downtime while lowering budgets."

With family he is playful and sings simple silly songs to the kids; with coworkers he's pragmatic, uses shorthand, and frequently references sports analogies to explain teamwork. He often gestures with his hands when telling a story and rubs the back of his neck when thinking. On the phone he prefers short, direct calls.
