            "description": "Karina works full-time as a line cook and sometimes fills an assistant manager role on busy weekend shifts. Her duties include prepping sauces and salsas, cooking proteins (grilled meats, carnitas), running the taco line during service, training new kitchen staff, ordering staples from suppliers, rotating inventory, and ensuring food safety and cleanliness. She is valued for speed, consistency, and her knowledge of traditional recipes that keep customers returning. She often works split shifts and occasional late evenings; schedule instability is a challenge. She has basic bookkeeping skills for small catering orders she takes for family events, and dreams of owning a small food business someday. Skills used daily: knife skills, time management, coordination with front-of-house staff, training colleagues, communicating in bilingual environments, and improvising when deliveries are late."
