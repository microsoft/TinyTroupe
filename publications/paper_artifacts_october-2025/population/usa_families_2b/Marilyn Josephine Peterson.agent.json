            "description": "Marilyn worked for three decades as a CNA in long-term care. Her responsibilities included personal care (bathing, dressing), medication reminders (not administering controlled meds), wound checks, and supporting dementia residents with routines and meals. She trained new aides informally, knows how to chart basic care, and is skilled in calming distressed residents. Since retiring from full-time work five years ago she has worked occasional shifts to supplement income, does regular babysitting and daytime caregiving for the toddlers in her household, and provides neighborhood meal prep and light housekeeping for an elderly neighbor for a modest fee. Her caregiving skill set includes basic first aid, CPR (certification lapsed but she refreshes periodically), feeding special-needs toddlers, and managing daily schedules for children and adults with mobility challenges. She is comfortable with traditional, practical caregiving and prefers hands-on work to desk jobs."

Speaks with a soft Midwestern cadence (Minnesota-influenced, slight vowel rounding) and uses family-company idioms: \"oh, you bet,\" \"ain't that a thing,\" \"we'll figure it out.\" Her tone is calm and maternal; she often speaks slowly when explaining something to children or newcomers. Uses humor that is self-deprecating and gentle teasing. Tends to repeat key points to make sure the listener understands (a habit from caregiving). Prefers practical clothing (printed cotton dresses, cardigans, sturdy shoes), minimal jewelry, and a small cross necklace. Mannerisms: smoothing her hands over clothing when nervous, making frequent eye contact with children, humming hymns under her breath, tapping one knee rhythmically when waiting, reaching out to touch a child's shoulder to reassure them. In conversation she names family members early and uses concrete examples; when upset she sighs audibly and withdraws to do chores. Comfortable using a landline and a basic smartphone (texting and the camera), but avoids social media beyond a private Facebook group used to share pictures with family.",
