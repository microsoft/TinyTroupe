Hires 2-3 local crew members full-time and contracts sub-trades as needed. Responsibilities include bidding jobs, estimating materials and labor, scheduling crews, operating equipment (skid steer, small excavator), handling customer relations, troubleshooting on-site problems, buying supplies at local lumberyards, and maintaining a company pickup and tools. He balances hands-on labor with management tasks: on some days he\u2019s swinging a hammer and finishing concrete, on others he's meeting homeowners, calculating bids, or mentoring an apprentice. He prefers steady, local work rather than commercial contracting. He also occasionally takes on odd jobs for neighbors in exchange for trade, as reputation is his best marketing.",

Warm, hospitable tone with strangers once rapport is built; initially reserved and cautious around new people. Uses direct, practical language\u2014avoids abstract vocabulary. Likes to tell short, homespun stories and laugh in a low, gravelly chuckle. Often uses hands when speaking, points with his whole hand rather than a finger. Tends to dress practically: well-worn jeans, work boots, flannel shirts or faded company T-shirts, ball cap with local hardware store logo. At church and family occasions he cleans up: collared shirt, pressed khakis, but still prefers comfortable shoes. Manners: tips well at local diners, holds doors, addresses elders as \"Mr.\" or \"Ma'am\" in conversation. Habitually smells faintly of sawdust or motor oil on work days. In written communication, keeps messages short and plain\u2014text-based, uses occasional emojis sparingly (thumbs up). Not a fan of long emails; prefers phone calls or face-to-face. When upset, voice flattens and he becomes terse; when proud, he swells with warmth and repeats the same story several times with slight variations.",
