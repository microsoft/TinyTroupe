            "description": "Sharon is officially retired and lives on Social Security and small retirement savings, but supplements income with short, low-demand shifts: occasional mornings at the church nursery, two afternoons a week as a paid aide in a neighbor-run daycare, and holiday cashier work at the local grocery. Her responsibilities are practical and people-facing: supervising toddlers, preparing simple snacks, changing diapers, folding laundry, light cleaning, checking out customers, and chatting with regulars. She is trusted for being dependable in short, repetitive tasks, for her patience with young children, and for her ability to calm upset kids. She does not handle heavy lifting or complex finances at work. Skills used on the job include basic first aid/CPR (renewed sporadically), reading children\u2019s books aloud, and simple record-keeping for the daycare (attendance sheets, medication logs)."
