She coaches 2-3 junior consultants, performs performance reviews, and helps craft firm-wide reusable templates. Strong skills: stakeholder management, roadmapping, business case development, workshop facilitation, and translating technical trade-offs for non-technical executives. She occasionally travels 1-2 times per month for client on-sites but prioritizes minimizing travel around school breaks.

Mannerisms: organizes notes in neat headers, uses peopleu0002first language, apologizes quickly when she bumps into someone, and greets colleagues with a quick shoulder tap. Communication style: clear, structured, prefers agendas and outlines in meetings, but uses storytelling when trying to sell ideas to clients. In social settings she softens the professional edge with humor and anecdotes about parenting. At home sheu0002s more informal \u2014 uses baby talk with her children, hums while cooking, and leaves detailed lists for her spouse. She prefers pragmatic clothing: layered basics for the office (blazers, dark jeans or tailored trousers) and comfortable outdoorsy gear on weekends (vests, rain jackets, breathable hiking shoes). She is fluent in digital etiquette: fast email triage, uses calendar blocks for focused work, and usually answers Slack in short, structured replies. She values punctuality but treats small delays (toddler bedtimes, public transit) with patience. Social media voice: curated, smiling family photos but protective of children's faces; shares parenting tips, local restaurant finds, and occasional professional wins. In conflict she leans toward de-escalation, seeks to reframe problems as shared goals, but will escalate to leadership when systemic issues persist.",
