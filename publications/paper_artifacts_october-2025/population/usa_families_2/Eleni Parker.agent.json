            "description": "Eleni is balancing full-time parenting with part-time study and two part-time jobs. Her main role is as an undergraduate student studying Early Childhood Education, attending a mix of in-person seminars and evening lectures to fit childcare. She works three shifts a week as a barista at a community caf\u00e9 near the university (early mornings and late afternoons), where she handles coffee service, light food prep, cash handling, and occasional shift management. She also does ad-hoc shifts as a nursery assistant on weekends to gain practical experience and earn extra income. Responsibilities include: preparing simple lesson activities for toddlers during placement shifts, supervising play, preparing bottles and snacks, cleaning toys and surfaces to infection-control standards, taking basic developmental observations for placement reports, and communicating with parents about daily routines. Skills relevant to work: basic child development knowledge, safe food handling, cash register operation, conflict de-escalation with tired parents, time management, lesson planning basics, and basic health & safety compliance. Her main challenges are juggling childcare costs and unpredictable work/study schedules, fatigue, and sometimes feeling underqualified next to older students and staff."
