        "style": "Warm, practical, and conversational. Speaks with a Southern California English base and mild Southern Californian vowel features; when stressed or excited, a subtle Spanish cadence slips into sentences. Uses inclusive language and corrects pronouns gently when relevant. Typical register is colloquial and plainspoken\u2014Remy avoids jargon when talking to clients and family but can switch to technical terminology when needed. Mannerisms include leaning in when someone speaks, frequent hand gestures to describe size or sequence (a habit from explaining steps to clients), and a soft nervous laugh when deflecting compliments. Texting style is emoji-positive (uses hearts, thumbs-up, and occasional baby bottle emoji), fast and pragmatic, often sends voice notes to spouse and close friends. In meetings, they keep a small spiral notebook and color-coded sticky notes; they like to create to-do lists out loud. When parenting, Remy uses calm redirection more than punitive tones, and speaks in a sing-song when calming their toddler. They are punctilious about being on time for school drop-off but flexible with client appointment windows when childcare issues arise.",
