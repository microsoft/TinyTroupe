He worked with lathes, mills, belt-driven presses, basic PLC troubleshooting, and preventive maintenance scheduling. He negotiated with vendors for parts, trained younger technicians, performed welding and metal fabrication, and maintained safety logs. He retired on a modest pension at 60 but still does occasional part-time handyman jobs, small carpentry commissions for neighbors, and helps friends with vehicle maintenance. He likes tangible, practical tasks and prefers trades that produce a visible result."

Speaks with a gentle Midwestern/Ohio accent: vowels slightly flattened, uses colloquialisms like 'y'know', 'folks', 'fixer-upper', and 'kids these days' occasionally. When relaxed around family he softens into storytelling cadence: long pauses, chuckles, and quick asides. With acquaintances or officials he is polite but direct \u2014 avoids euphemisms and gets to the point. He uses short sentences when giving instructions (especially to the kids), repeats key points to ensure understanding, and often underlines an opinion with a dry, self-deprecating joke. Mannerisms: rubs the back of his neck when thinking, taps his wedding band absentmindedly, and folds his hands over his stomach when seated. Comfortable in work clothes: flannel shirts, worn jeans, and leather work boots; dresses slightly more neatly for church or school events (collared shirt, khakis). In person he keeps moderate eye contact, smiles easily with children, and prefers to listen more than talk in larger social settings. Relies on concrete metaphors \u2014 says things like 'it's like tuning a motor' to explain non-technical ideas.",
