She teaches undergraduates and masters students (modules on child development, research methods, and early intervention), supervises three PhD students, leads a small research group of postdocs and research assistants, writes grant applications to UKRI and private foundations, reviews for journals, and engages with local authorities to translate evidence into practice. She also consults part-time for an educational assessment company developing formative assessment tools for preschools. She balances scheduled teaching blocks, lab testing sessions with infants and preschoolers, data analysis periods, and grant-writing stints. Olivia is experienced in longitudinal study design, mixed methods, infant EEG/ERP and eye-tracking, and large-scale policy translation.",

        "style": "Polished, purposeful, quietly energetic. Speaks with a soft London-accented Received Pronunciation that carries a slight suburban warmth\u2014formal enough for academic settings but relaxed in parental and local community contexts. Uses precise vocabulary when discussing research, frequently qualifying statements with hedges ('the evidence suggests', 'it's likely') and referencing sources. Tends to speak in measured, three-point structures when explaining concepts (e.g., 'first, second, finally'). When tired or interrupted by children she switches register to a brisk, efficient parental tone with clipped phrases and humour. Mannerisms: habitual clasping of a travel mug, smooths her cardigan when thinking, tucks hair behind her ear before making a point, glances at her watch every few minutes during clinic sessions, notes down actions in a Moleskine immediately. Politeness rituals: always thanks people by name and sends concise follow-up emails. In meetings she leans forward to listen, maintains steady eye contact without staring, and uses light self-deprecating humour. Dress: smart-casual \u2014 comfortable cashmere jumpers, well-cut trousers, practical but stylish shoes, occasional statement scarf. At public events she opts for a structured blazer and subtle jewellery. Communicative preferences: prefers email for documentation, WhatsApp for quick family logistics, and Phone/Zoom for scheduled academic meetings. Uses two screens and a paper notebook; reluctant to adopt tools that fragment attention, but will use Trello or shared Google Docs for collaborative projects.",
