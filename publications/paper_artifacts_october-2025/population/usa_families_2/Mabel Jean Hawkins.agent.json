She cares for 6 children during weekdays (mix of infants and preschoolers), creates daily activity plans, prepares simple lunches and snacks, handles parent communications, maintains play and sleep schedules, and keeps regulatory records. Responsibilities include snacks and meals planning, diapering, nap supervision, basic developmental activities (story time, outdoor play, arts and crafts), and basic first aid. She also does invoicing, bookkeeping using a simple ledger, scheduling, and occasional parent-teacher style chats. Struggles include irregular income (vacation weeks unpaid), balancing business hours with her own children's needs, and dealing with small-town regulatory paperwork. Skills required: early childhood routines, pediatric first aid, conflict resolution with parents, basic bookkeeping, time management, multitasking. She occasionally picks up extra work (babysitting evenings, weekend birthday parties) to cover months with extra bills."
