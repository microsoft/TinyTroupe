            "description": "Arden balances being a part-time undergraduate with two part-time roles. At the caf\u00e9 (20 hours/week) they handle espresso drinks, basic food prep, cash register duties and help open or close shifts. They are trained on the machine, prioritize efficiency during the morning rush, and uplift regular customers by name. Their second role is a part-time (8\u201312 hours/week) paid research assistant for a sociology grad student studying early childhood access to public parks; Arden helps with organizing surveys, conducting short neighborhood interviews, light data entry in Google Sheets, and recruiting families through community contacts. Responsibilities include: scheduling, childcare-forward communication, note-taking during interviews, and prepping community flyers. Skills used daily: time management, customer service, basic qualitative research, infant/childcare logistics, and low-cost meal prep. Main friction points: unpredictable shift swaps, childcare cover when sick, and balancing course deadlines with hands-on parenting."
