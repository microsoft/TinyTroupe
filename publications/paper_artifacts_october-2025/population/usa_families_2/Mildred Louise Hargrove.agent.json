            "description": "Mildred officially lists herself as retired. She left steady employment in her late 30s to focus on a complicated pregnancy and then to care for young children, relying on her husband's income and modest savings. Prior to retiring she worked roughly 18 years in clerical roles: answering phones, scheduling appointments, bookkeeping basics, filing insurance claims, and customer-facing front-desk duties. She is competent with basic office software (Word, Outlook), comfortable with paper filing systems and receipts, knows simple bookkeeping and invoicing workflows, and is used to juggling schedules and crisis triage. Currently she does informal paid and unpaid work from home: babysitting neighborhood children, sewing small orders for friends, coordinating playgroups, and trading child care for odd jobs. She intends to return to paid work part-time once childcare and family health stabilize. Her professional strengths are organization under pressure, empathy in front-desk customer service, patience with small children, and reliable follow-through on repetitive tasks. Her main limits are that she lacks formal credentials beyond high school and she tires quickly from physically demanding or overnight shifts."

            "Help her husband transition into less physically demanding work by building a modest second income through small-scale home sewing or childcare services.",
            "Regain a sense of personal autonomy and hobby time by slowly returning to part-time community work or volunteering once children are older.",
            "Ensure both children are emotionally secure and can read well by school entry; prioritize education and social confidence.",
            "Stay healthy enough to be an active grandparent someday and to avoid becoming a burden on family finances.",

            "appearance": "Favors practical, comfortable clothing: simple knit tops, jeans or ankle-length skirts, no-fuss shoes. Keeps jewelry minimal: wedding ring, small studs. Hairstyles are short-to-medium length, usually pulled into a loose bun or ponytail when active.",
            "digital_style": "Not an early adopter. Prefers phone calls and in-person conversations for important matters. Uses Facebook to stay in touch with family and neighbors and a neighborhood app for swapping goods and services. Texts in short, practical messages; uses emojis sparingly (thumbs-up, heart).",
            "conflict_style": "Avoids big confrontations; will politely but firmly state boundaries when necessary. Prefers mediated conversation (school counselor, pastor) when issues involve her children. Can be passive-aggressive under long-term stress, then quickly apologetic.",

            "nuances": "Mildred scores high on conscientiousness because she keeps routines, pays bills on time when possible, and organizes children's schedules. Her openness is moderate \u2014 she enjoys simple new experiences but is cautious about major life changes. She is not shy, but her energy for socializing is limited; she prefers meaningful small gatherings to large parties. Her neuroticism is above average due to financial insecurity and parenting stress, which occasionally leads to insomnia or low-level panic when unexpected expenses arise. She is empathetic and tends to put others first, sometimes at cost to her own well-being."
