            "description": "Currently unemployed in formal terms. Historically has worked intermittently in informal and manual jobs: day laborer on construction sites, helper for a local carpenter, occasional vendor at a mercado, and short-term gigs moving appliances. Responsibilities when employed included heavy lifting, basic masonry tasks, mixing cement, loading/unloading trucks, helping with simple installations, and doing repair work around neighbors' houses for small cash payments. He is used to unpredictable schedules, cash-in-hand payment, and bargaining for higher pay for hard tasks. He can operate basic hand and power tools, understands construction site safety informally, and has basic knowledge of materials and local supply stores. Major difficulty: irregular income, limited access to formal job channels and references, lack of recent formal credentials. Skills and practical knowledge exist but are undervalued in the formal job market. He actively looks for day labor through his neighborhood union of trabajadores or via acquaintances in construction but struggles to secure steady full-time employment."

The relationship is affectionate and pragmatic: they make financial decisions together, co-parent closely, and share household chores. Mar\u00eda is more cautious about taking risks and manages most of the household's paperwork. Their communication is generally open, though they both avoid explosive, prolonged arguments and try to resolve financial stress quietly."
