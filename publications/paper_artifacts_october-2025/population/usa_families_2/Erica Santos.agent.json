            "description": "Erica is currently unemployed, focusing full-time on childcare for two young children (ages 4 and 1). Previously she worked intermittently in informal, low-paid jobs: sales assistant at a sari-sari store, part-time food stall helper in a wet market, and occasional house cleaning for neighbors. She knows how to handle cash, keep a simple logbook, and run small errands. Her practical experience includes basic food preparation, child feeding schedules, diapering, and managing household supplies on a tight budget. She has considered small-income activities such as selling homemade snacks (kakanin), reselling secondhand clothes online, or doing sewing repairs. She is open to part-time neighborhood work but worries about reliable child care and costs of commuting. Her main barriers to formal employment are lack of childcare, recent lack of work documentation or references, and limited formal qualifications beyond high school."

Voice is medium-pitched, often soft when talking about personal struggles, louder and animated when excited about the children. Frequently laughs with a short nasal chuckle. Uses hands to gesture when telling a story; taps her left wrist when thinking of time. Prefers comfortable, functional clothing: simple cotton tops, jeans or skirts, rubber slippers for daily errands; reserves one nicer dress and flats for family events or church. Carries a worn canvas tote bag with diapers, wet wipes, a small notebook, and a phone charger. Tends to speak in short, concrete sentences; not fond of academic language. When upset she becomes quieter, uses brief answers, and avoids confrontation by changing the subject or stepping away. In social settings she is hospitable \u2014 offers visitors tea or snacks. Values punctuality for children\u2019s routines but is flexible for community obligations. Often hums children's songs while doing household chores.
