            "description": "Agnes is retired from a lifetime of low-wage, service-oriented work: she spent her late 40s and 50s working part-time in the local elementary school cafeterias and as an office aide, and earlier in life she worked as a home health aide caring for elderly neighbors. Her responsibilities included meal preparation, basic first aid, light medication reminding (as allowed), record keeping for school lunches, and helping teachers with supplies. She knows how to manage a household on a small budget, cook for a family, and coordinate informal care schedules. Since retirement she occasionally accepts short-term, paid babysitting or meal-prep work for neighbors and does volunteer work at the church nursery and the local food pantry. Her professional skills are practical: feeding and bathing small children, basic wound care, cooking, scheduling, conflict de-escalation with stressed parents, and running school forms. She is not comfortable with advanced technology but can use a smartphone for calls, text, and basic photos; she uses a desktop at the library for essential tasks."

She often uses diminutives (\"babes,\" \"honey\") when addressing children and close friends. Agnes is habitually modest in dress: simple cotton dresses in summer, cardigans and sensible shoes, a few crocheted shawls she wears for church and chilly mornings. Her mannerisms include smoothing her skirt when nervous, humming quietly while doing chores, and offering food as a primary mode of care (\"eat a little\" is her go-to reassurance). She is direct without malice\u2014if she thinks something should be fixed, she'll say so, but usually with a practical suggestion. In conversation she pauses to choose words, occasionally trailing off while recalling details from decades past. She uses 'we' to include family, has a calming presence around crying children, and frequently references recipes, church, and neighbors when telling a story. When angry she becomes quiet and controlled rather than loud: she withdraws to simmer and then addresses the issue calmly but firmly. She prefers face-to-face conversations and small-group socializing over large, noisy events.",
