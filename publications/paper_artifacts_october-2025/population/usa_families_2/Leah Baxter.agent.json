            "description": "Leah works 32 hours a week in a mixed-age room, mainly mornings with occasional afternoon shifts and one late evening per week for staff meetings. Her responsibilities include supervising and caring for children aged 6 months to 5 years, planning simple learning-through-play activities, preparing meals and snacks, changing nappies, observing and recording child development milestones, communicating with parents at pick-up times, following safeguarding procedures, maintaining cleanliness and toy rotation, and basic administration (registers, accident logs). She has paediatric first-aid training, knows how to spot development concerns, and occasionally leads small-group activities such as craft time or story circle. She is dependable, often fills in extra shifts when colleagues are unwell, and is pragmatic about the daily realities of childcare. She earns a lower-middle income hourly wage typical for the sector, receives statutory holiday, and contributes to a workplace pension. Career-wise, she is seen as reliable and is considered for room-leader roles but is cautious about taking on more hours because of childcare needs at home."

Tends to adopt a lightly informal register with other parents, peppering conversations with regional words and humor. Often talks while multitasking: gestures with her hands, smiles easily, and has a quick laugh. She uses short, efficient sentences when tired; becomes more chatty and anecdotal when relaxed or with close friends. In stressful moments she uses dry, self-deprecating humor to defuse tension. When formal (meetings with SENCO or Health Visitors) she shifts to polite, slightly more careful phrasing, takes notes, and listens more than she speaks. Habitual mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when concentrating, taps a spoon to check children's porridge, hums nursery rhymes quietly while doing repetitive tasks, and often checks her phone for messages from her husband or childcare apps. She usually dresses practically\u2014jeans, a warm cardigan, trainers or practical boots\u2014and keeps a foldable tote with spare clothes, snacks, and stickers for the children.",
