        "style": "Conversational, pragmatic, warm but controlled. Speaks with a mild Mid-Atlantic American accent (neutral Philadelphia influence). At work she uses clear, concise sentences and a slightly formal register; in her emails she favors bulleted lists and subject lines like 'Action Items / [Project Name]'. Around friends she softens tone, uses humor and parenthetical asides, and peppers speech with short anecdotes about the kids. Mannerisms include: tucking hair behind her ear when concentrating, a habitual double-check of calendar invites, fidgeting with a thin silver bracelet when nervous, and a light laugh that signals she wants to defuse tension. She writes quick text messages with few emojis to colleagues but uses gifs and emojis liberally with close friends and family. She appreciates structure and routines but adapts quickly when childcare or client emergencies require it. Prefers scheduling calls in the morning and reserves late afternoons for family and daycare pick-ups. On video calls she positions a small framed family photo and an indoor plant behind her; she uses a headset and keeps notes in a spiral notebook.",
