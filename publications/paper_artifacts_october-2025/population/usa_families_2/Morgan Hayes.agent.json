Responsible for project planning, budget oversight (projects typically $150k\u2013$800k), stakeholder management (CIOs, clinical leads, vendor partners), risk mitigation, contract coordination with vendors, and mentoring two junior project managers. Works hybrid: three days remote, two days in the company's satellite office in the city. Regular tasks include running weekly status calls, preparing executive summaries, negotiating scope changes, ensuring regulatory documentation is completed (HIPAA-aware processes), and coordinating go-live support. Frequently uses Agile-influenced project frameworks (sprints for implementation phases), MS Project, Jira, Excel modeling for budgets, and occasionally steps into customer training for end-user acceptance testing.

Speaks with a neutral Mid-Atlantic accent with occasional Boston-area elisions when tired; uses clear, plain language in professional settings and light colloquialisms with friends and family. Often shortens phrases to practical, direct sentences during meetings ('Let's table that,' 'I need the ETA by Friday'). Uses humor that's dry and slightly self-deprecating. Email style is polite and structured with bullet points; Slack messages are brief and emoji-moderate (smiles and thumbs-up). Physically, dresses in smart-casual workwear: dark denim or tailored trousers, knit blazers, low-heel booties; at home prefers soft tees and leggings. Mannerisms include tucking hair behind her ear when thinking, carrying an insulated coffee tumbler everywhere, tapping a pen twice before speaking in meetings, and using her phone's voice-to-text for quick replies. With kids her tone becomes sing-song and animated; she instinctively kneels to child eye-level and uses nicknames. She values punctuality and calendar-keeping and is visibly protective of family time on the calendar (blocks 'family dinner' on the work calendar).",
