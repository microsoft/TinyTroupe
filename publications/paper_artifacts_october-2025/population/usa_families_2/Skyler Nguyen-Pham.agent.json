            "description": "Skyler splits time between being a university student and working part-time (20-25 hours/week) at a local non-profit preschool. As a preschool assistant their responsibilities include supervising children aged 6 months to 4 years, preparing simple lesson materials based on lead teacher plans, assisting with diapering/toileting and naps, facilitating outdoor play, preparing and serving snacks that follow allergy plans, communicating daily with parents, documenting developmental milestones for the lead teacher, and helping to maintain the classroom environment (sanitizing toys, arranging art supplies). They often translate written notices into Vietnamese for a few families. Skyler is also responsible for supporting inclusive practice for children with diverse needs and occasionally leads circle-time activities and short story sessions. Skills relevant to this role: basic curriculum planning, child observation and documentation, nonviolent communication, basic first aid and infant/child CPR, bilingual communication (English-Vietnamese), and budgeting for classroom supplies. Challenges include unpredictable hours, low pay without benefits, and emotional exhaustion during busy weeks when children or family members are sick."

        "style": "Warm, conversational, practical and slightly informal. Skyler speaks with a Portland-area American English accent with occasional inflections from family Vietnamese expressions (code-switches to Vietnamese words for food, family terms, and endearments). They typically address kids with a sing-song, patient cadence and adults with a friendly, direct tone. When tired or stressed they uses short sentences and apologizes often. Mannerisms include: rubbing the back of their neck when anxious, a frequent half-smile when deflecting praise, using hand gestures to demonstrate actions when explaining things to children, and a habit of repeating instructions twice to ensure understanding. Skyler prefers layered, comfortable clothing\u2014cardigans, soft tees, leggings or relaxed jeans, and usually wears a crossbody diaper bag. They keep their phone on vibrate and use a shared family calendar app (Cozi) and texting for quick logistics. In formal settings (university meetings, parent-teacher conferences) Skyler shifts into a more structured mode\u2014notes out, prepared questions, and formal salutations\u2014yet still prefers to keep interactions friendly rather than overly formal. Uses they/them pronouns and will correct people gently but firmly if misgendered. On social media they present a mix of candid parenting updates, student-life memes, and community activism shares; they avoid flashy or curated 'influencer' aesthetics.",
