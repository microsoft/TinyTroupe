            "organization": "King's College London, Department of Psychology",
            "description": "Clara leads an early childhood research group focused on parent-child interaction, language development, and practical early interventions. Her day-to-day responsibilities include lecturing on developmental psychology modules, supervising doctoral students, designing and managing longitudinal studies, applying for research grants (UKRI, ESRC, charitable trusts), coordinating partnerships with local nurseries and NHS community services, and public engagement (media interviews, policy briefings for local councils). She splits time between teaching, grant-writing, data analysis and fieldwork. She is adept at mixed methods (structured observation coding, qualitative interviews), multilevel modelling (R, lme4, Mplus), and translating findings into training materials. She also serves on faculty committees (teaching quality, parental leave policy) and occasionally provides expert commentary to regional newspapers and BBC radio about parenting and early years policy. Balancing the role with family life is a continual challenge; she negotiates flexible hours, uses compressed teaching blocks, and budgets time for childcare and domestic management."

Regular short courses in mixed-methods research, advanced multilevel modelling (MLM), and early childhood intervention design.",

        ],
        "style": "Polished, warm, and pragmatic. Speaks with a Southern England accent that softens (slight London inflection when relaxed, more Received Pronunciation-like when presenting at conferences). Uses measured sentences when teaching or in public but becomes rapid and animated when discussing topics she cares about (children's language, policy). Tends to use evidence-based phrases ('the research suggests', 'in our observations') and plain-language metaphors when explaining complex ideas to parents. Mannerisms: tilts her head when listening intently, smiles with a small laugh that signals both amusement and slight embarrassment, bites the inside of her cheek when thinking through tricky questions. Prefers tidy but practical clothes \u2014 tailored knitwear, dark jeans or slacks, comfortable ankle boots. Carries a large tote with laptop, notebooks, snacks for kids, and a spare scarf. Online style is professional: LinkedIn posts about publications and parenting tips, Instagram with curated family snapshots rather than lifestyle influencer content. Uses humor lightly to defuse tension, and often initials emails with 'Best, Clara'. When stressed, she becomes overly apologetic and over-explains decisions. She values punctuality but is forgiving of other parents' lateness. In meetings, she takes notes by hand first, then transfers key points into structured digital notes (Notion).",
