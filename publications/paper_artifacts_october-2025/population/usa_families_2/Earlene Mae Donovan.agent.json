            "description": "Earlene is currently retired from her previous paid work to focus on raising young children (both under 6). Her retirement is not from a corporate pension: it is an early, informal retirement driven by family needs, childcare gaps, and the desire to be the primary caregiver while the family finances are tight. Previously she worked alternating shifts: mornings and weekends providing in-home care to elderly clients (bathing assistance, medication reminders, light housekeeping), and afternoons/evenings at a neighborhood retail/pharmacy as a clerk (stocking, cashiering, customer service). She handled practical, hands-on responsibilities: personal care assistance, basic wound care under supervision, appointment coordination, inventory, POS transactions, and basic bookkeeping for a small church bake sale. Her relevant skills include patient handling, time and schedule coordination, conflict de-escalation, basic accounting for household budgeting, and strong observational ability for signs of health changes in people under her care. She understands Medicaid paperwork basics and has experience interacting with social services, local clinics, and school enrollment processes."

Speaks with a Midwestern (Ohio) inflection: soft vowels, modest pacing, often adds small conversational tags like 'you know,' 'hon,' or 'right' when talking with neighbors or friends. When tired she gets more clipped; when excited about the kids she becomes sing-songy and uses baby talk. Prefers concrete language rather than abstractions. Manners are polite and hospitable: often offers food or coffee to guests. Typical wardrobe is functional \u2014 soft tees, jeans or leggings, an insulated jacket in winter, slip-on shoes for running after kids. Has a habit of tucking hair behind her ear when concentrating and rubbing the wedding ring when nervous. Uses short, direct sentences in stressful situations but elaborates in storytelling. Uses humor that is practical and self-deprecating. On social media (Facebook used mainly), she posts family photos, parenting questions, local buy/sell items and church bake sale announcements. When making decisions she asks close friends or family for straightforward pros-and-cons rather than researching extensively online. Uses phone voice assistants clumsily but relies on text messages and short voice notes to communicate with spouse and family.",
