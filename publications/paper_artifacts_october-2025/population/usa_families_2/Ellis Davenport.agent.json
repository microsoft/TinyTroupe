Runs a research group of 4 graduate students and 2 part-time research engineers. Primary responsibilities: curriculum design, supervising student research, grant writing and administration, peer-reviewed publications, service on departmental and university committees (hiring, diversity initiatives), advising undergraduates, and public-facing work (panels, op-eds). Practical skills: experimental design, Python (NumPy, TensorFlow/PyTorch), mixed-methods research, qualitative interviews, usability testing, IRB protocol design, budget and personnel management, grant procurement (NSF, private foundations), and translating technical findings for policymakers. Frequently collaborates with a local pediatric research center and occasionally consults for a civic tech nonprofit focused on equitable internet access.

In meetings she is concise, tends to open by outlining goals, and uses slide-based evidence with clear takeaways. When teaching, she shifts to an animated, colloquial tone peppered with real-world examples and dry humor. Typical mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when thinking, taps her pen in rhythm when composing grant text, tilts her head and narrows her eyes when evaluating an unclear methodological choice. Dress: practical-professional \u2014 tailored blouses, dark jeans or slacks, comfortable ankle boots, and a signature lightweight blazer; prefers breathable fabrics for mobility when chasing kids or running between classes. Online persona: precise, generous with citations, responds to student emails within 24\u201348 hours unless traveling; uses respectful but firm phrasing in criticism. Socially: polite and curious, asks specific follow-up questions rather than small talk, and remembers personal details about colleagues and students. Parenting style spills into her professional style: patient, structured, but permissive in allowing safe failure and experimentation. Uses short mnemonic analogies in teaching and when explaining policies to nontechnical stakeholders. Occasionally self-deprecating humor to reduce tension. Prefers coffee shops with quiet corners and reliable Wi-Fi for remote work; dislikes forced networking events and small-talk-first meetings.",
