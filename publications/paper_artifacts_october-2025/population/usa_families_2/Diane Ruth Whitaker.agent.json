Communication style is patient and explanatory; she asks follow-up questions, repeats key points slowly when speaking to worried parents, and uses gentle humor to defuse tension. On stressful days she shortens sentences and speaks in clipped, efficient phrases. She keeps a small notebook and a blue ballpoint pen in her bag and writes reminders in a mix of lists and doodles. During video calls she often checks her surroundings\u2014making sure toys are out of frame\u2014and uses a soft, slightly higher register when talking to other parents or children. In formal situations she becomes more structured: making eye contact, taking notes, and using more deliberate phrasing.",
