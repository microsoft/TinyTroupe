They manage a small project team (3-5 people), act as the main liaison for medium-sized hospital and clinic clients, scope technical integrations, and translate clinical workflows into feasible product features and implementation plans. The role demands technical fluency, practical UX sense, negotiation, and people management skills. Emerson often balances client demands, internal engineering timelines, and contract constraints. Responsibilities include scoping and discovery workshops, drafting Statements of Work, overseeing configuration and testing, leading weekly status calls, training client super-users, and ensuring go-live support. Emerson writes technical documentation, coordinates with customer success for retention, and occasionally helps define minor product features based on recurring client feedback.",

        "style": "Conversational, pragmatic, and a little dry \u2014 Emerson speaks with a soft California-accented American English with a slight, occasionally noticeable Vietnamese-American intonation when stressed. They prefer plain, unadorned language, but can switch to concise, formal phrasing for client meetings or documentation. Mannerisms: folds hands when thinking, uses specific hand gestures to describe timelines (taps imaginary Gantt chart), tends to smile while delivering critique to soften feedback, often starts sentences with 'Okay' or 'Right' when clarifying, and frequently checks a calendar or pocket notebook mid-conversation. In social settings they are warm but reserved; their laughter is quiet and progressive. Emerson uses gender-neutral language consistently, prefers first names, and apologizes reflexively when interrupting. They moderate tone to match listeners: more animated with other parents, more formal and structured with clinical or executive stakeholders. They value clarity and hate jargon without explanation. When writing, Emerson uses bulleted lists, clear headings, and example scenarios. They keep their workspace tidy but surrounded by small family photos, a well-used French press, and sticky notes with toddler milestones.",
