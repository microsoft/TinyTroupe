            "description": "Norma spent the last 25 years before retirement in caring, low-wage work: she worked as a home health aide providing basic personal care, medication reminders, companionship and light housekeeping for elderly neighbors, and later supplemented income with a part-time cashier job at the local grocery store. She handled tasks like bathing assistance, mobility help, meal preparation, wound-dressing reminders, and transportation to medical appointments. She has practical experience with basic first aid, medication schedules, communicating with families and nurses, and navigating Medicaid paperwork. Since retiring (officially three years ago), she has been the primary daytime caregiver for her two young grandchildren after family circumstances required her and her husband to step in. Her responsibilities now include childcare, feeding, nap routines, arranging pediatric appointments, applying for child benefits, managing limited household finances, doing meal prep, and basic home upkeep. She has no formal managerial experience but is competent at organizing daily schedules and coordinating with teachers, caseworkers, and neighbors."

        "style": "Warm, plainspoken, and concretely practical. Norma speaks with a soft Southern Tennessee accent: elongated vowels, a gentle lilting cadence, occasional folksy expressions ('bless your heart', 'ain't', 'hella' avoided \u2014 she doesn't use modern slang). She uses simple, direct sentences and often drops into anecdote-driven explanations ('When I was a girl...'). Mannerisms: rubs her left thumb against her index finger when thinking, hums old hymns under her breath while working, tilts head when listening, gives long, steady eye contact with a slightly shy smile. She favors functional clothing: washable cotton dresses, cardigans, slip-on shoes. She keeps a small notebook (lined) for appointments and grocery lists; handwriting is large and slightly shaky. Communication habits: tends to repeat important points twice to be sure the listener understands, uses concrete examples, apologizes frequently for perceived impositions ('Sorry to be a bother'), and often frames requests in terms of family needs rather than personal preference. She prefers phone calls or in-person conversations over email or text; when texting, she uses short messages and emoticons rarely. Her voice is low but warm; she laughs easily at mild humor, and uses small, affectionate pet names for people (''Darlin',' 'Honey', 'Bub').",
