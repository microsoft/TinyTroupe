            "description": "Amari is a full-time elementary school classroom teacher, responsible for planning and delivering daily lessons in literacy, math, social studies and social-emotional learning for a classroom of ~20-24 students. She writes lesson plans aligned to state standards, assesses student learning through formative and summative assessments, communicates with parents about progress and concerns, and coordinates with special education and support staff when students need accommodations. She leads small-group interventions, manages classroom behavior using consistent routines, and incorporates play-based activities for early learners. Administrative responsibilities include attending weekly grade-level meetings, submitting reports, participating in parent-teacher conferences, and occasional after-school events. She has expertise in differentiated instruction, basic classroom technology (Google Classroom, interactive whiteboards), and trauma-informed classroom strategies. Time management and balancing individualized student needs with curriculum pacing are ongoing challenges. Outside the classroom she occasionally tutors neighborhood children and leads a weekly reading circle at the local library."

Often uses short, concrete sentences when explaining tasks to students and longer, reflective sentences in conversations with friends. Frequently uses examples and metaphors drawn from children's books, playgrounds, and everyday family life. Mannerisms include: tucking hair behind her ear when thinking, a soft laugh that puts others at ease, frequently checking a phone or calendar for scheduling, making sticky notes and color-coded lists, and using hand motions when describing classroom activities. When stressed she bites the inside of her cheek and talks more rapidly. Generally approachable and warm in tone, but firm and direct when setting boundaries or discussing children's behavior. Prefers practical language over jargon; when talking about policy or pedagogy she will translate technical terms into concrete classroom actions. Social style is relationship-oriented: remembers names, asks about families and uses humor to defuse tension. Comfortable with small talk but prefers conversations that lead to problem-solving or emotional support.",
