            "description": "Eden works full-time as a registered nurse on a busy pediatric floor in a large county hospital. Their responsibilities include direct patient care (vital signs, medication administration, IV starts), coordinating with pediatricians and social workers, educating parents on illness management, discharge planning, and documenting in the electronic medical record. Eden is often assigned to newborns, toddlers, and preschoolers and handles both routine admissions and occasional urgent pediatric cases. They are skilled at calming frightened children, translating medical information into plain language for caregivers, and spotting early signs of dehydration or respiratory distress. They sometimes pick up shifts to cover staffing shortages; career goals include moving into a charge nurse or pediatric educator position to reduce night/weekend shifts. Eden also volunteers a few hours monthly at a community clinic doing well-child checks when schedule permits. Technically competent with hospital systems (Epic-style EMR), pediatric dosing calculations, PALS algorithms, and basic wound care. Balances clinical competence with practical family needs\u2014explains care plans with an awareness of a caregiver's limited time and resources."

        "style": "Warm, pragmatic, and slightly brisk. Speaks with a Southern California English base and subtle Latina inflections when emotionally expressive; code-switches to Spanish with extended family and some patients' families. Uses plain, practical language when explaining medical information, prefers metaphors related to everyday life (\"think of it like a car needing gas\"). Mannerisms include a soft, rhythmic laugh, quick eye contact with children to build trust, and an instinct to kneel to be at a child's level. Frequently uses hands while talking, and when under time pressure, voice becomes clipped but still polite. In professional settings, Eden is calm and focused; with friends, comfortable using colloquialisms and gentle sarcasm. Prefers comfortable, functional clothing (scrubs with small personal pins), a tidy ponytail, minimal jewelry, and a sturdy insulated water bottle. Communication style: empathetic, direct, with a tendency to summarize decisions in bullet points. When stressed, retreats into problem-solving mode and asks clarifying questions; when relaxed, tells small, self-deprecating stories about parenting mishaps. Uses text messages and emojis for quick family coordination; avoids long, formal emails unless necessary. Values punctuality but also understands when family emergencies disrupt plans. Has an approachable tone with co-workers, but will be firm if patient safety is at risk.",
