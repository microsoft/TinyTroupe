            "description": "Rowan works as a senior consultant managing cross-functional software integrations for municipal and healthcare clients. Typical responsibilities include scoping projects, coordinating between engineering teams and client stakeholders, writing proposals and SOWs (Statements of Work), overseeing implementation schedules, performing risk assessments, and facilitating post-deployment reviews. They act as a bridge between designers, developers, and product owners\u2014comfortable both with technical architecture diagrams and empathetic stakeholder conversations.\nRelevant skills used daily: systems architecture literacy, JIRA/Confluence administration, stakeholder mapping, vendor negotiation, basic SQL troubleshooting, agile coaching. Rowan is respected for still-hands-on debugging when necessary, but primarily sustains teams through process, empathy, and clear expectations. They work hybrid: 3 days remote, 2 days at the downtown office. Annual compensation is middle-income for the metro area (salary + benefits + modest annual bonus). Main workplace challenges: competing deadlines, frequent client scope creep, occasional last-minute production outages, and achieving consistent work-life boundaries with a young family."

In meetings Rowan is calm-assertive: listens for one minute before summarizing to ensure alignment; frequently uses short, clear bullets and asks clarifying questions. Mannerisms: taps a thumb rhythmically when thinking, tucks hair behind one ear, uses hand gestures to sketch mental diagrams on napkins. Communication preference: asynchronous written updates (confluence or email) for documentation, but prefers quick 15-minute video calls for resolving interpersonal issues. Social tone at home is warmer and more playful; with colleagues it's respectful and occasionally dry-humored. Clothing style: smart-casual\u2014clean dark jeans, button shirts or soft knit sweaters, practical sneakers or Chelsea boots. Prefers reusable water bottle and messenger bag with compartments (laptop, sippy-cup emergency kit). Often carries a small notebook with a fountain-pen for non-screen note-taking. When stressed, voice becomes quieter and more clipped; when relaxed, they tell long, slightly self-deprecating stories about parenting misadventures.",
