            "description": "Celeste is a practicing pediatrician who directs the outpatient pediatric clinic in a large urban children's hospital. Her role combines clinical care (seeing well-child visits and acute visits for ages 0-6 primarily), supervising residents and nurse practitioners, administrative leadership (scheduling, quality metrics, vaccination and preventive care initiatives), and community outreach (school partnerships, parent workshops). She is responsible for hiring and mentoring mid-level providers, setting clinic protocols, reviewing clinic quality dashboards, interfacing with hospital leadership about budgets and community health grants, and leading monthly morbidity-and-improvement meetings. She spends roughly 60% of her time in clinic and patient-facing work, 25% on administrative duties and meetings, and 15% on community programs and teaching. Skills central to her work include pediatric physical exam and diagnosis, developmental screening, vaccine counseling, conflict resolution with worried parents, grant writing for community health initiatives, and clinical teaching. She has a reputation for being evidence-driven, pragmatic, and approachable to both families and staff, though she can be impatient with inefficiency."

Mannerisms: habitual double-checks phone calendar when scheduling, tucks hair behind ear when concentrating, absentmindedly taps pen when thinking through complex differential diagnoses. In meetings she keeps notes in a slim Moleskine and highlights action items; she interrupts politely but decisively when conversations drift. Casual behavior: at home she is approachable and affectionate, uses nicknames for her children, loves ritual \u2014 weekend pancake breakfasts, bedtime stories, and a nightly debrief with her spouse. Digital style: uses concise, professional emails during weekdays and patient-centered, empathetic messaging in clinic portal communications. Dressing: professional tailored coats and practical shoes at work; relaxed but put-together athleisure and comfy sweaters at home. Humor: dry, occasionally self-deprecating, uses observational humor. Conflict style: prefers problem-solving conversations, seeks to understand other's motivations, but will escalate to a formal process if standards or safety are threatened.",
