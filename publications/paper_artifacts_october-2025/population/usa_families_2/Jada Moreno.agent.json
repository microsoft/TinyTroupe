At the preschool she assists lead teachers with group activities, diapering and feeding younger children, preparing simple lesson materials, supervising naps and outdoor play, and communicating informally with parents at drop-off/pick-up. She is relied upon for practical childcare skills and patience with toddlers. At the independent bookstore she works afternoon/evening shifts: restocking children's sections, recommending picture books and parenting titles, running the register, and sometimes organizing storytime on weekends. Her responsibilities include light administrative tasks, maintaining a calm and welcoming environment, and occasionally covering for absent staff. Skills used daily: child supervision, storytelling, basic classroom management, customer service, cash handling, inventory, bilingual communication (English/Spanish). Career constraints: part-time hours, irregular shifts, limited benefits; hopes to transition to a stable full-time preschool teacher role after completing her degree and certification."
