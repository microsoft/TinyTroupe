            "description": "Eleanor retired from full-time elementary teaching at age 59 after 33 years in public school. She responds well to routine, lesson planning, and child-focused activity design. Now she works 18 hours a week at the local public library as a circulation and children\u2019s program assistant: shelving, running story time, registering families for events, and liaising with the preschool community. She also picks up occasional mornings as a paid classroom aide at Morning Star Preschool when the center is short staffed. Responsibilities include planning simple story-based activities for toddlers, supervising small groups, handling basic record-keeping for attendance, assisting in craft prep, and supporting parents who need brief referrals to community resources. Skills applied in this role: classroom management, age-appropriate activity design, strong verbal communication, patience, basic administrative tasks (filing, simple spreadsheets), and community outreach. She left full-time teaching partly for health and to manage the demands of caring for two young children; part-time work offers social contact and modest supplemental income."

        "style": "Warm, deliberate, and slightly old-fashioned in speech. Eleanor speaks with a Mid-Atlantic/Pennsylvania suburban cadence: measured, with soft intonations and occasional colloquial turns of phrase ('bless her heart', 'oh my'). She often begins stories with sensory details ('I remember the smell of...') and uses knitting metaphors or gardening metaphors when explaining things. Politeness is important: she says 'please' and 'thank you' automatically and writes handwritten thank-you notes for gifts. She favours cotton cardigans, sensible shoes, and practical hairstyles (short, easy to wash). Mannerisms: clasps hands when listening, tilts head when confused, hums quietly when doing repetitive tasks (cleaning, folding laundry), and makes eye contact to reassure people. In public or with officials she is pragmatic and slightly formal; with neighbors and other parents she is chatty though reserved about personal finances. She tends to interject small funny observations to ease tension and softens critiques with praise. Technology style: cautious and utilitarian \u2014 uses smartphone and email, but prefers phone calls or in-person conversation for important matters. She plans, writes lists on paper, and keeps a modestly organized binder for the children\u2019s records, medical info, and schedules.",
