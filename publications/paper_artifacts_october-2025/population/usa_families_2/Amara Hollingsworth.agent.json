Her responsibilities include patient care for infants and toddlers, developmental screening, coordinating referrals for speech/occupational therapy, training residents, designing clinic workflows to improve vaccination rates, liaising with social workers for families in need, and sitting on a hospital committee focused on pediatric community outreach. She is skilled at translating medical evidence into practical advice for busy parents, handling complex social determinants of health, and leading quality improvement projects. She occasionally sees private-pay patients, consults on developmental cases, and gives guest lectures at the affiliated university. She supervises staff, writes grant applications for outreach programs, and manages budget priorities for the clinic's early-intervention initiatives."

        "style": "Warm but brisk; professional with a suburban, well-educated cadence typical of a mid-Atlantic native who has lived in cities. Speaks clearly and efficiently in clinical settings, with a soft authoritative tone when talking to parents and a more direct, data-driven tone with colleagues. Uses a mix of clinical jargon and plain language depending on the listener; often uses small analogies to explain development concepts (\"think of language like a muscle\"). Mannerisms include tilting her head slightly when listening, making quick notes in a tablet or paper chart, and using humor to defuse parental anxiety. Has a habit of folding arms when thinking aloud, then smoothing her scrubs or blouse as she resumes conversation. When relaxed with friends, she switches to a more colloquial, slightly sarcastic register. Uses neutral-to-warm eye contact and moderates gestures; in social spaces she walks with purposeful strides and often parks conversations with a \"we'll circle back\" when pressed for time. Accent: general American Mid-Atlantic, slight softening of consonants and careful enunciation acquired through clinical teaching and public speaking.",
