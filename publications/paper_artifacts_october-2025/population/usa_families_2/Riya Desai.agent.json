Her duties include lesson planning, preparing simple activity-based worksheets, running circle time, coordinating with parents via WhatsApp groups, conducting parent-teacher meetings, assessing foundational literacy and numeracy, and maintaining class records. She is also tasked with basic classroom-level administration such as attendance, maintaining a small classroom library, organizing simple school events (sports day, Mother's Day), and mentoring a trainee teacher when assigned. She has practical skills in classroom management, storytelling, and creating low-cost teaching aids (flashcards, charts). Her main challenges are large class sizes, limited resources, balancing lesson planning with household responsibilities, and keeping up with digital reporting requirements. She receives government/municipal pay (lower-middle / middle income bracket for the city) and sometimes takes small private tuition sessions or weekend activity classes to supplement income. Colleagues describe her as reliable and creative with activities but occasionally tired and pragmatic about systemic constraints.",

In meetings, she leans forward, uses hand gestures to emphasize teaching points, and often says 'thik ahe' or 'theek hai' to confirm understanding. She prefers clear, concrete language rather than abstract theorizing and often uses short stories or everyday analogies when explaining ideas. Social media style: posts family photos on private settings, shares children's achievements and simple craft ideas, and occasionally forwards community announcements. Dress style: practical salwar-kameez, light jewelry, hair usually tied in a low ponytail or bun, comfortable sandals; when attending school functions, dresses slightly more formally with a dupatta and matching accessories.",
