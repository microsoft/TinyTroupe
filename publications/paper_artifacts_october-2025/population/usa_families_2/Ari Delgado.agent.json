            "description": "Ari balances course work with two part-time, traditional positions. At the community college library they shelve books, staff the front desk during evening hours twice a week, help students find basic resources, and assist with simple circulation tasks. At the elementary school's after-school program they supervise a group of 10\u201312 children (ages 5\u201310), lead craft and reading time, organize snacks, and communicate with parents at pickup. Both roles require punctuality, patience, clear communication, basic clerical skills, and the ability to manage interruptions. Ari's primary professional strength is hands-on work with children and logistical organization; their main challenge is time management across study, work, parenting, and home life."

Uses friendly colloquialisms common in the Mountain West (phrases like \"y'know,\" \"we're just trying,\" and \"that was a handful\"). Slight residual accent from a mixed-background household \u2014 vowel sounds are neutral American but with occasional upward inflection when asking rhetorical questions. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind the ear when concentrating, uses hands a lot while explaining things, laughs in a short, breathy way, and often glances to the side when thinking of a child's schedule or a chore that needs doing. Tends to apologize reflexively (\"sorry, hang on\u2014kids\") even for minor interruptions. When teaching or explaining, adopts a calm, patient cadence and uses analogies based on daily life (laundry, meals, schedules). Prefers practical clothing (soft tees, worn jeans, sneakers), carries a large diaper bag that doubles as a work bag, and owns a battered notebook full of to-do lists, appointment notes, and a sketchy meal plan. On social media, posts are sporadic: mostly photos of children, short parenting reflections, and occasional local community event shares. Values directness but tempers it with kindness; will politely correct misinformation but avoids public shaming.",
