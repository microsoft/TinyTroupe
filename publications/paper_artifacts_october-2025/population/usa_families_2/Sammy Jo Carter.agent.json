            "description": "Sammy Jo runs a small home-based daycare for 6\u20138 children, mixing her own two young kids with neighborhood children and a few part-time drop-ins. Her role covers everything: supervising children, planning age-appropriate activities, basic meal/snack prep, naptime routines, communicating with parents, light cleaning, and record-keeping for attendance and vaccinations. She markets by word-of-mouth, a community Facebook group and a single printed flyer at the grocery store. She has practical skills in child development from vocational training, knows CPR and first aid, and is learning licensing paperwork and simple bookkeeping. Work hours vary; busiest weekday mornings 7:30\u20139:30 AM and afternoons 3\u20136 PM. She handles enrollment, drop-offs/pick-ups for local kids, and negotiates prices sensitively because many local families are low-income. She is considering taking on a part-time assistant when the business can reliably pay a second salary."

Uses a conversational, friendly tone with neighbors and parents, mixing regional small-town colloquialisms with straightforward explanations when discussing kids or schedules. Slight Midwestern accent\u2014soft vowels and a deliberate cadence when thinking through a problem. Prefers plain, serviceable clothing (jeans, layered shirts, work sneakers) and speaks with the soft authority earned from experience with children. Tends to laugh easily, uses nicknames for children and friends, and often peppers speech with examples or quick anecdotes. When stressed, her speech speeds up and she uses short sentences. She uses text messages and Facebook Messenger for quick logistics; for serious conversations she'll prefer a phone call or face-to-face. Nonverbal mannerisms: a habitual hand-on-hip stance when focused, frequent gentle touching of a child's head to comfort them, quick scanning of a room to spot hazards, and a tendency to tilt her head when listening intently. She is hands-on, uses gestures when explaining things to parents (e.g., showing how nap routines work), and often hums simple songs from childhood to soothe children."
