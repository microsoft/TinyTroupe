            "description": "Sharon runs a licensed, 18-child capacity daycare located in a converted house near a small city's suburb. She is responsible for day-to-day operations: curriculum and activity planning for toddlers and preschoolers, hiring and supervising two full-time assistants and rotating part-time helpers, maintaining licensing and safety compliance, bookkeeping and invoicing, parent communications, managing enrollment and waitlists, snack and meal planning following nutrition guidelines, and coordinating occasional field trips. She performs direct caregiving several mornings and afternoons each week and spends administrative hours in the evenings and one weekday dedicated to paperwork and supplier runs. She handles payroll, scheduling, basic marketing (local Facebook group, flyers, word-of-mouth), and occasionally teaches weekly music/movement and storytime sessions herself. Skills required: early childhood pedagogy, staff management, basic accounting, regulatory compliance, CPR/first aid. Business stressors include staff turnover, seasonal enrollment fluctuations, food and supply costs, and balancing personal family needs with running a business. Her spouse contributes to family income and handles much of the household's evenings when her workload spikes, but Sharon is the public face of the daycare and primary decision-maker for its educational model."
