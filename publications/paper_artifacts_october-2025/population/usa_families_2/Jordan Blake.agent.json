            "description": "Jordan leads cross-functional implementation projects for electronic health record modules and ambulatory practice management software targeted at community hospitals and physician groups. She is responsible for: scope definition, budget tracking (projects she runs typically range from $150k to $800k), timeline creation and maintenance, stakeholder communication (clinicians, billing managers, CIOs), risk management, on-site and remote go-live coordination, training plans for end users, and post-go-live stabilization. She supervises a small team of analysts and coordinates with consultants, quality assurance, and client-side IT staff. Her role requires translating clinical workflows into technical requirements, negotiation with vendors/partners, and frequent executive summaries for clients. She is hybrid (3 days remote, 2 days onsite/client visits per month), commutes ~30 minutes on days she needs the office, and regularly uses Jira, Confluence, MS Project, Excel (pivot tables), and Tableau for dashboards. She mentors two junior PMs and occasionally leads internal training sessions on implementation best practices. Career-wise she wants to move to a director role managing multiple implementation portfolios while preserving family time."

        "style": "Jordan speaks in a measured, practical tone with a mild Mid-Atlantic/General American accent shaped by years living near the D.C. area. At work she is crisp and organized: short, action-oriented sentences; she uses phrases like \"circle back,\" \"let's scope it,\" \"on my radar,\" and \"run the dependency matrix.\" She often types quick, emoji-light Slack responses (thumbs-up, calendar emoji) but prefers synchronous check-ins for complex issues. With friends she relaxes into colloquial language and self-deprecating humor; with family she is affectionate and sings short nursery rhymes when calming children. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when concentrating, taps pen lightly during calls, uses hand gestures to enumerate points, sets phone to \"Do Not Disturb\" during focused work blocks but keeps a soft alarm for family reminders. She favors practical clothing (smart casual \u2014 knit dresses, tailored jeans, flats) and carries a well-worn tote that includes a reusable water bottle, snacks for kids, a small notebook, and a portable charger. She is punctual, prefers planned agendas for meetings, and dislikes very long improvisational sessions without clear outcomes. She often closes conversations with \"Let's land on that\" or \"I'll follow up with a note.\"",
