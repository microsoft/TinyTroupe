            "description": "Daniel is a senior software engineer focusing on backend systems and payment infrastructure for a fintech company. He designs microservices that handle high-volume transactions, owns reliability and observability for several core services, and leads a small team of 3 engineers. Responsibilities include system architecture decisions, designing fault-tolerant data pipelines, mentoring junior engineers, performing on-call rotations, writing technical RFCs, and collaborating with product managers and compliance/legal for new features. He spends roughly 40% of his time designing systems and code reviews, 30% mentoring and meetings, 20% hands-on coding, and 10% aligning with product and security. Key skills used at work: distributed systems, API design, SQL tuning, Kubernetes, Go and Python, CI/CD pipelines, observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana), and basic financial domain knowledge (payments, reconciliations, settlements). He prefers well-tested, maintainable designs and is cautious about premature optimization. Frequent tension: balancing time between shipping features quickly and maintaining high reliability standards demanded by finance."
