            "description": "Jos\u00e9 spent about 45 years working in agriculture and seasonal manual labor\u2014planting, harvesting, and packing produce for nearby farms and packing houses. He often worked long days, sometimes with temporary employers, and occasionally did small construction and repair jobs for neighbors to earn extra cash. He never had a stable employer-sponsored pension; his retirement income is a modest Social Security check and small savings. Responsibilities during his working life included operating and maintaining small machinery (tractors, irrigators), pruning, planting, running irrigation lines, lifting heavy boxes, and supervising transient crews on occasion. In retirement he still does light handyman work: fixing fences, patching roofs, basic plumbing, and gardening. He has practical, hands-on expertise, an intuitive mechanical sense, and a reputation locally as someone who can jury-rig a solution with limited tools and materials. He struggles with paperwork, tax forms, and dealing with bureaucracies unless someone helps him translate and explain things step-by-step."
