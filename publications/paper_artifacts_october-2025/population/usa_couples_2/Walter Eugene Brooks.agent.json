            "description": "Walter works as a healthcare support worker in a rural/small-town setting. His primary responsibilities include assisting elderly residents with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, feeding), monitoring vitals and incidents, documenting care notes, transferring patients safely, prepping simple meals, and providing companionship. He often picks up extra shifts to make ends meet. Because the facility is small, Walter also helps with light housekeeping, transporting residents to local appointments, and occasionally driving the facility van. He has practical hands-on experience in patient handling, basic wound observation, and emergency response (CPR certified). His schedule is variable: some early mornings, some evening shifts, and weekend coverage. The work is physically demanding and emotionally draining at times; he is valued for his patience, steady hands, and ability to calm agitated residents, but he worries constantly about medical bills he cannot afford and the health of his own body (aches, rising blood pressure). He has no supervisory role but informally mentors newer aides.",
