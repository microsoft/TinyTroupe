Responsibilities include: attending classes, researching and writing essays, organizing a campus bilingual book club, volunteering at her neighborhood library two afternoons per week helping with storytelling for children, assisting a small local zine with copy-editing and submissions, and coordinating community reading events with her church youth group. She has basic familiarity with library cataloging concepts, ISBN conventions, and submission guidelines for small presses. Her practical struggles include balancing course load with family obligations, navigating financial aid and FAFSA paperwork, and occasionally taking on short freelance editing tasks when time allows."

Speaks with a Northeastern American English accent flavored by Spanish intonation at home; code-switches comfortably between English and Spanish depending on the listener. Uses colloquial, friendly language with peers and becomes more formal and carefully phrased in academic or bureaucratic contexts (professors, financial aid offices). Often gestures with her hands while speaking, laughs easily, and predisposes to storytelling. In written communication she aims for clarity and a slightly literary voice (likes well-chosen metaphors). She dresses casually but thoughtfully: thrifted denim, sneakers, layered jewelry with a few sentimental pieces from family, occasional dresses for church or events. She keeps her phone and a small notebook handy, uses emojis liberally with friends, and adopts a warm, persuasive tone when organizing events. Tends to be animated in group settings and will often adopt an inclusive 'let's do this' phrasing when coordinating others. When stressed, voice becomes quieter and she avoids eye contact for brief periods. Has a habit of repeating key words for emphasis (\"seriously, seriously\") and tapping a pen when brainstorming.",
