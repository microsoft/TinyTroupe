Prefers clear, structured sentences and avoids filler words. Uses confident but gentle assertiveness in meetings \u2014 leans on facts and charts rather than rhetorical flourish. Registers small verbal cues: says 'let's be candid' when shifting to blunt feedback, and uses 'for context' to reframe points. Uses email templates for routine communications, but personalizes for high-value relationships. Clothing style is classic-professional: tailored blazers, silk blouses, clean lines, muted palettes, with a few signature accessories (a thin gold watch and a small pearl bracelet). At social dinners she relaxes into a warmer register with dry, wry humor. Mannerisms: organizes meeting notes in a slim leather folio, taps a pen twice before speaking to collect thoughts, smiles briefly before delivering critique, warms beverages (tea or Americano) slowly and prefers small sips. In-person she favors eye contact, nods to signal listening, and closes conversations with a concrete next step. On the phone she places her left hand on the desk while taking notes; on video calls she arranges books and a plant behind her to project calm competence.",
