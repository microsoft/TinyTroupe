            "description": "Harper is a junior gameplay engineer focusing on core gameplay systems and player-facing features. Her day-to-day responsibilities include implementing mechanics specified by designers, debugging and optimizing code in C++ and C#, writing unit tests for gameplay modules, integrating artist and animator feedback, and running playtests to iterate on tuning values. She pairs frequently with a designer to prototype new ideas, documents systems in the studio wiki, and occasionally scripts small narrative events using the studio's proprietary toolchain. Harper also contributes to build pipelines, resolves regressions reported by QA, and helps triage crash reports. She is expected to continually improve code quality, learn engine internals (Unity and a custom C++ engine), and contribute to postmortems and design discussions. Harper is still building leadership and cross-disciplinary communication skills and aspires to lead a small gameplay team within 3\u20135 years. Her role demands both technical rigor and empathy for players and artists."

        "style": "Casual West Coast tech vernacular with bright, quick speech when excited about games or new ideas; more measured tone when discussing bugs or technical tradeoffs. Uses colloquial language with occasional gamer jargon and playful sarcasm. Often code-switches between technical terms and everyday metaphors (\u201cit\u2019s like a state machine but with feelings\u201d). Physically, Harper favors functional, layered clothing (graphic tees, flannels, hoodies, comfortable sneakers) and minimal jewelry. She moves quickly, has an easy laugh, and uses hand gestures when explaining designs. Online, she is concise in pull requests but verbose and enthusiastic in design docs and Discord chats. In-person, she tends to maintain comfortable eye contact, often tilts her head when listening, and unconsciously taps her foot or fingers when debugging. Prefers asynchronous written communication for complex topics and short video calls for design demos. Has a dry sense of humor and light self-deprecating jokes; comfortable admitting mistakes but dislikes being micromanaged. Uses emojis in informal messages (\\u201c:seedling:\\u201d for experimental prototypes, \\u201c:bug:\\u201d for regressions). Speaks with a soft Pacific Northwest accent, slight Mandarin inflections when she remembers a phrase from home, and a cadence shaped by streaming commentary (pacing, emphatic beats).",
