        "style": "Gregory speaks in a clear, measured Midwestern-turned-Southern cadence: a neutral Midwestern base with softened vowels from living in the South for a decade. He favors straightforward, slightly formal language in professional settings (uses full sentences, avoids slang in meetings) and becomes warmer and more colloquial with friends and neighbors. Mannerisms: folds hands when thinking, taps the rim of a coffee mug when listening intently, maintains steady eye contact but nods to signal agreement, habitually checks his watch twice when wrapping up conversations (small ritual). He dresses conservatively: collared shirts, chinos, occasional sport coat for client visits; weekends are polo shirts and hiking shorts. Digital style: organizes email into folders, uses bullet lists in messages, prefers concise agendas before meetings. Humor: dry, self-deprecating, leans on benign sarcasm. Conflict style: conflict-avoidant but pragmatic \u2014 will negotiate calmly, seeks compromise, relies on data and precedent to defuse heated debates. He reads aloud numbers or outcomes to ensure clarity in meetings. He uses idioms occasionally (\"let's table that\"; \"run the numbers\"). He is comfortable with small talk about local sports, weather, and kids in the neighborhood despite having no children himself. He speaks with patience to older coworkers and less technical teammates, but can become brisk when timelines are tight. In written communications he is organized, uses headers, and values follow-up notes. In social situations he offers to help with practical tasks (grill, set up chairs) and prefers hands-on involvement over long speeches.",
