He directly supervises a crew of 4-8 laborers and carpenters, schedules subcontractors (electricians/plumbers), reads blueprints, orders materials, coordinates deliveries, and enforces on-site safety. He spends part of each day doing hands-on carpentry\u2014framing, finish trim, installing cabinetry and doors\u2014and part of the day managing logistics and client communication. He has experience operating a skid steer and small excavator, is competent with a circular saw, table saw, and nail guns, and does basic finish carpentry like trim and cabinetry when needed. He estimates materials for bids, tracks hours for payroll, enforces OSHA rules, and trains new hires and apprentices. He negotiates minor change orders with clients and escalates larger disputes to the project manager. His role requires practical problem solving, time management, basic accounting for job costs, and people skills to keep clients and crew satisfied."
