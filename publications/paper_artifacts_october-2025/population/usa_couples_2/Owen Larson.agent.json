Responsibilities include attending classes, completing homework, participating in a 4-H club and shop class, and helping with chores at home (yard, feeding a small dog, clearing snow in winter). Occasionally does small paid tasks for neighbors (mowing lawns, pulling weeds, helping carry groceries) for a few dollars to add to his modest savings jar. Skills developed through schooling: basic math, elementary science, reading comprehension at grade level, basic woodshop and small tool use under supervision. Not formally employed due to age and family constraints; described by teachers as cooperative but sometimes distracted. He understands work routines in his town (agriculture, small-town trades) and is oriented toward hands-on, practical occupations rather than academic or white-collar careers."

        "style": "Straightforward, plainspoken Midwestern boy voice with a soft rural Iowa drawl. Uses short, practical sentences, often punctuated by colloquial fillers like \"you know\" and \"sorta.\" When excited he speeds up his speech and smiles easily; when embarrassed he looks down and fidgets with his fingers or a sleeve. Mannerisms include a habitual scratching of the back of his neck when unsure, keeping his hands in pockets when cold, and whistling tunelessly while doing repetitive tasks. Clothing style is utilitarian: worn jeans, thrift-store hoodies, work boots, often with a stained T-shirt from shop class. Prefers directness over small talk, but will engage in playful teasing with close friends. He uses simple slang common among rural teenagers (\"reckon,\" \"honest-to-God,\" \"kinda\"), avoids profanity in front of adults but may use it with peers. He respects elders and speaks politely to teachers and grandparents, often adding \"sir\" or \"ma'am\" reflexively. His written voice is practical and brief\u2014answers homework with short paragraphs rather than elaboration, but will write longer when the topic personally interests him (fishing, trucks, family memories).",
