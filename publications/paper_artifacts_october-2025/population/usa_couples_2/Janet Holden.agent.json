            "description": "Janet works full-time as a library technician, formally handling circulation desk duties, interlibrary loans, basic cataloguing, and the maintenance of the physical collection for adults and children. Over the last 10 years she has taken on a de facto role coordinating community programs: planning story-hours, arranging pet-therapy visits, organizing a monthly 'senior social' afternoon, and doing outreach to nearby schools and community centers. She runs the library's social media posts (simple announcements), trains new volunteers, troubleshoots basic desktop and printer issues for patrons, and supervises a small team of part-time shelving aides. Her role requires patience, clear communication, modest technical skill (cataloguing software, MS Office, basic ILS tasks), and the ability to manage modest budgets for programming and supplies. She has institutional knowledge of purchasing procedures and municipal reporting, and she's known for practical problem-solving and steady, reassuring interactions with patrons and staff."

        "style": "Janet speaks with a gentle, northeastern suburban accent\u2014soft New England vowels, practical and conversational. She tends to be warm but slightly reserved with strangers, quick to smile, and habitually polite. Her mannerisms include a steady, deliberate pace when explaining things, a fond habit of tucking hair behind her ear when reading, and short, reassuring hums while shelving. She dresses conservatively and practically: soft knit cardigans, sensible low-heeled shoes, and worn-in scarves in autumn. In public she favors comfortable clothes over fashion trends and usually carries a mid-sized tote with a thermos, a paperback, and treats for her dog. When instructing volunteers or patrons she uses clear short sentences, often repeating key points and following up in writing. In emails she writes in complete sentences and signs off with a friendly closing. She frequently references local events or common acquaintances as a conversational bridge. She's neither fussy nor flamboyant\u2014her voice is calm and measured, and she uses humor gently, often self-deprecating. When stressed she becomes quietly focused and slightly more curt, but never rude. She dislikes jargon and explains library rules with plain examples. She prefers face-to-face interactions for complicated matters and short phone calls or email for confirmations. She uses simple analogies to explain technology to older patrons and can be encouraging rather than patronizing.",
