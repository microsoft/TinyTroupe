            "description": "William works primarily as a CNA and home health aide in a rural region. His duties include assisting elderly patients with activities of daily living (bathing, dressing, toileting), taking and charting vital signs, helping with mobility transfers, preparing simple meals for clients, administering medication reminders (not injections), and providing companionship. He sometimes drives clients to medical appointments. He works a mix of early shifts and a few longer weekend shifts each month; he is officially part-time which keeps his annual household income under the $25,000 band. He is experienced with dementia patient behaviors, safe transfer techniques (Hoyer lift familiarity), basic wound observation (reporting but not performing advanced wound care), and HIPAA/resident privacy practices. He handles paperwork and digital charting on a basic tablet, but prefers written notes. Work is physically demanding and emotionally taxing; he is often the steady calming presence at the bedside. His employer values his dependability and cooking skills (they ask him to help with special meal days)."

Speaks deliberately, often pausing to find the right word when anxious. When comfortable with someone, he warms into storytelling mode \u2014 slow cadence, laugh that starts in the chest. Mannerisms: frequently taps his wedding band when thinking, rubs the back of his neck when stressed, instinctively straightens his scrubs or shirt before entering a room, keeps his palms open when talking to show he means well. He dresses pragmatically: scrubs or polo and slacks for work, worn denim and work boots off-shift, an old ball cap in bad weather. At church and community events he favors a pressed shirt and a modestjeans/khaki look. He uses humor as a buffer against worry, telling small self-deprecating jokes. Phone speech: texts in short sentences and uses voice messages more than written texts because he finds it faster. In conflict, he tries to de-escalate but can grow terse and defensive if someone challenges his competence around caregiving or cooking. He likes to hum while working in the kitchen or when washing dishes.",
