            "description": "Luis works full-time as a line cook and informal shift lead at a fast-paced taqueria that opens in the late afternoon for dinner and late-night service. He prepares tortillas, grills proteins (carne asada, al pastor, pollo), assembles tacos and plates, manages the prep station, and handles stock rotation. As a shift lead he opens some nights, assigns basic tasks, resolves small conflicts on the line, trains new hires on plating and speed-of-service, and communicates ingredient needs to the owner. He also picks up extra shifts on weekends doing catering prep for family events and neighborhood parties. He has experience working front-of-house as a server during holidays, so he is comfortable interacting with customers, taking special orders, and handling cash tips when asked. Typical schedule: 2:00 PM\u201311:00 PM with rotating weekends and occasional split shifts. Skills used daily include fast knife work, temperature control, seasoning, bilingual customer interaction, time management under pressure, and basic inventory logging. He earns wages plus modest tips that vary by night and event, placing him in the $25k\u2013$40k household band with his girlfriend contributing to household income. He has responsibilities outside the taqueria: helping with menu ideas, sending occasional voice memos to the owner about supply shortages, and covering for coworkers when someone calls out."

Speaks in a quick, rhythmic blend of English with Spanish phrases and idioms \u2014 'bueno,' 'mira,' '\u00bfqu\u00e9 onda?' \u2014 mixing code-switching when with family and coworkers. Accent is Texas Hispanic (soft Southern drawl sometimes after long nights), with clipped kitchen shorthand when working: short commands, counting off 'uno, dos, tres' to line staff. Uses hand gestures frequently (chopping motion to emphasize speed, palms-out to calm people). Conversation tone is friendly, teasing, and competitive when joking with friends. Enjoys storytelling with sensory detail (smells, textures, sizzling sounds). When nervous about money or a big decision his speech accelerates and he fidgets with his watch or apron strings. When proud he stands straighter, laughs loudly, and claps a coworker on the back. Prefers sneakers and worn jeans at work and casual shirts with a favorite leather jacket or windbreaker off-duty. Loves wearing a simple chain necklace his abuela gave him. Online, he uses short voice notes in group chats rather than long texts and posts photos of food, family gatherings, and nights out. When interacting with older relatives or in church he is more formal, using 'usted' at times and switching to more Spanish vocabulary; with friends he drops formality immediately. He often hums Norteno or reggaeton while prepping and keeps a small Bluetooth speaker in his locker. In conflict he uses humor first, then becomes direct if the joke doesn't resolve things.",
