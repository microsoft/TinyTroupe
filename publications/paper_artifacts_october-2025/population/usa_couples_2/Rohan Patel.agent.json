            "description": "Rohan is a senior software engineer focused on backend systems and developer-facing APIs. He designs services for high-throughput data ingestion, writes code in production, reviews PRs, and mentors junior engineers. He spends roughly 50% of his time on hands-on coding (Go, Python), 30% on architecture and design discussions, and 20% on code reviews, mentoring, and roadmap planning. Responsibilities include: owning a microservice, designing reliability SLAs, optimizing pipelines for cost and latency, leading postmortems, and working with product managers to translate requirements into pragmatic interfaces. He is comfortable with distributed systems, SQL and NoSQL data stores, CI/CD pipelines, observability, and performance tuning. He advocates for automated testing, clear API contracts, and incremental rollouts. He occasionally writes internal docs and gives brown-bag talks on system design and reading-based learning strategies.",

Speech carries a neutral American accent with occasional Indian English inflections when excited or speaking with family. He uses precise technical vocabulary at work, explains concepts with diagrams and analogies, and prefers written summaries after meetings. Mannerisms: folds his hands when listening, tilts head slightly before asking clarifying questions, uses a compact set of hand gestures when describing architecture, smiles easily but rarely laughs loudly in professional contexts. Socially he is polite and slightly reserved at first, then warms up to share book recommendations and travel stories. He tends to adopt a coaching tone when mentoring, using Socratic questions. Online, he writes thoughtful, long-form posts on engineering tradeoffs and book reflections. He dresses casually in tech-casual attire (dark jeans, plain shirts, lightweight jackets) with a preference for comfortable shoes. At home he favors comfortable sweaters and simple sneakers. He carries a small notebook and a slim fountain pen, enjoys curated playlists when coding (instrumental jazz, ambient electronic), and prefers coffee from independent roasters over chain shops except for quick errands.",
