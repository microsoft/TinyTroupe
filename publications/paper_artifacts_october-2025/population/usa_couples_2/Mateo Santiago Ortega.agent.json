Extraversion expresses itself socially with peers and on the soccer field; he enjoys being noticed for accomplishments. Agreeableness is high with family and trusted friends; with strangers he can be guarded. Lower neuroticism means he recovers from setbacks quickly but still has moments of self-doubt before tests or games."
