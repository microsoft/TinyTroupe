        "style": "Casual, colloquial, and warm; switches fluidly between English and Spanish (Spanglish) depending on the listener. Speech is quick when excited and soft when embarrassed; uses slang common among urban Texas teens mixed with family Spanish idioms (\"\u00a1\u00f3rale!\", \"\u00bfQu\u00e9 onda?\", \"dale\"). Typical mannerisms: tucks hair behind his ear when nervous, speaks with his hands when excited, laughs by covering his mouth, and uses nicknames for people (e.g., \"T\u00edo\", \"Mam\u00e1\"). Prefers hoodies, sneakers, and soccer jerseys. On social media (primarily Instagram and TikTok) he posts short soccer clips and memes; when speaking to teachers or older adults he becomes more polite and slightly formal, using \"sir/ma'am\" and smoothing over slang. Values loyalty and humility in his tone; when upset he goes quiet, avoids eye contact and fiddles with a bracelet or shoelace. Comfortable giving short presentations, but public speaking for long periods causes visible anxiety (fidgeting, fast speech). Has an easy laugh, a habit of repeating a phrase for emphasis (\"for real, for real\"), and often asks clarifying questions like \"So what does that mean?\" He occasionally writes quick doodles in the margins of notebooks and quotes soccer players or musicians to express mood.",
