            "description": "Derek is a journeyman carpenter who commonly acts as site foreman on residential renovation and small commercial jobs. Responsibilities include: reading and interpreting blueprints for remodels, framing and finishing carpentry, on-site crew supervision (3-8 people), coordinating subcontractors (electricians, plumbers), ordering and tracking materials, enforcing safety protocols (OSHA basics), clocking and documenting daily labor hours, basic client communication and change-order explanations, occasionally operating skid-steer and forklift. He estimates labor and simple costs for small jobs, mentors apprentices, and steps in for hands-on work on tight schedules. He excels at problem-solving on-site, improvising practical fixes when plans conflict with field conditions, and keeping the job moving when deadlines are tight. He is paid hourly with overtime and occasional premium on-call pay; household income falls in the $50k\u2013$99k band when combined with his wife's part-time income."

Typically casual and approachable in manner: a firm handshake, steady eye contact, and a slow-to-medium-paced voice. Laughs loudly, tells work stories, and punctuates explanations with small gestures (thumbs-up, pointing at imaginary studs). He uses short text messages with emojis to his wife and friends, prefers phone calls for quick coordination at job sites, and often speaks in metaphors drawn from tools or machines. Mannerisms: scratches his jaw or rubs the back of his neck when thinking, taps a work boot rhythmically when seated, and unconsciously runs a thumb along his wedding band while listening. Politeness and conflict avoidance are noticeable: he smooths over disagreements with jokes, agrees to compromise, and defers to elders or clients when tension rises. In formal settings (permitting permits, city office, subcontractor meetings) he cleans up language, speaks respectfully, and brings a notebook with measurements and notes.",
