            "description": "Blair is a senior in-house lawyer responsible for negotiating complex service-provider agreements, advising on regulatory compliance across multiple jurisdictions, structuring cross-border investment products, and partnering with product, compliance, and marketing teams to launch new strategies. She drafts and reviews fund formation documents, leads due diligence for third-party managers, manages outside counsel relationships, and is a primary contact for regulators on licensing and disclosure matters. Key responsibilities: contract negotiation, regulatory interpretation (SEC, FINRA, EU frameworks), internal policy design, crisis response for reputational issues, mentoring junior counsel, and overseeing pro bono programs. She travels several times per quarter for client meetings and conferences, is proficient with legal research platforms, Bloomberg, and financial models at a conceptual level, and often translates legal constraints into commercial options for senior business leaders. Her role requires discretion, stamina, and the ability to reduce legal complexity into executive-level decision points."

        "style": "Measured, professional, and quietly confident. Speaks in clear, precise sentences, with careful word choice shaped by legal training; uses analogies from contracts and markets to explain everyday trade-offs. Slight New England cadence\u2014polite but brisk; rarely rises to profanity. Prefers neutral, high-quality clothing (tailored blazers, silk blouses, dark denim for casual) and values function: a classic watch, low-key jewelry, well-maintained leather tote, and minimalist sneakers for travel. Mannerisms: steeples fingers when thinking, takes notes in a slim leather notebook then transfers actions to a shared task tracker, rolls eyes barely when someone confuses correlation with causation; has a small, habitual smile she uses to defuse tension in meetings. Uses technology deliberately: calendar blocked religiously, AirBnB and preferred hotel apps, digital boarding passes, and a curated set of email templates. When relaxed socially, she adopts a warmer, slightly more jocular tone but remains a careful listener. In conversation, she asks clarifying questions, favors evidence, and returns to topics across days to show follow-through. Prefers coffee rituals (single-origin pour-over at home) and a glass of red wine in the evening. Public-facing voice is polite and serviceable; private voice is wryly observant and analytic.",

A relatively low neuroticism score indicates she copes well with stress but perfectionism can create occasional sleep interruptions. Extraversion at mid-level: she enjoys networking events for their purpose (connections and learning), but prefers small dinners to rowdy mixers. Emotionally, she processes via lists and action items rather than airing feelings publicly; when stressed she becomes quieter and increases control over routines."
