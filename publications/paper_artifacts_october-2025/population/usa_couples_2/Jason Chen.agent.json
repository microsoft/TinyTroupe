He occasionally prototypes ML-backed fraud signals but is primarily focused on robust, low-latency distributed systems. Technical skills applied: system design, distributed systems, message queues (Kafka), relational and NoSQL databases, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/GCP, monitoring/alerting, security best practices. Soft skills: clear written communication, stakeholder alignment, mentoring, pragmatic trade-off decisions. Compensations and perks align with an upper-middle household income band: base salary in the mid six-figures total compensation when factoring equity and bonus, health benefits, and 401(k) contributions."

Socially, he's warm but reserved: quick with wry humor, appreciative of irony, and tends to listen more than dominate conversations. Mannerisms: tucks his phone facedown at the table, rubs the bridge of his nose when explaining complex systems, speaks with hands when excited about a technical concept, and laughs with a soft, short chuckle. Email/Slack voice: uses polite headers (\"Quick question:\", \"Proposed plan:\"), clearly delineates next steps, and often signs off with practical items like \"PTA: I'll handle the follow-up.\" In casual settings with friends he relaxes into informal language, drops tech jargon, and teases gently. Around family he is deferential to elders and uses honorifics in Mandarin.
