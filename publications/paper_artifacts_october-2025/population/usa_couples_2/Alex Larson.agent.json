Responsibilities include attending classes, completing homework, participating in choir and 4-H meetings, maintaining at least passing grades to stay eligible for extracurriculars, helping at home with chores (cleaning, errands, pet care), and occasionally babysitting neighborhood children for modest pay.

Has completed middle school with average-to-above-average grades in core subjects. Enrolled in regular-track classes with occasional honors sections (English honors last year). Participates in after-school programs: choir, school newspaper (contributor), and the 4-H club. Limited access to AP classes at her school; would need to travel to the regional high school for advanced courses.

When speaking to adults (teachers, grandparents), switches to a more polite and clipped register, saying 'yes ma'am' or 'no sir' sometimes out of habit. Texting uses lots of emojis and abbreviations.",
