You're learning time management between academics and social life, experimenting with leadership by co-captaining a small after-school robotics sub-team. You sometimes tutor younger students in math for pocket money through family connections. You are not in the labor force and have no formal employment."

Mannerisms: fidgets with a pen or phone when thinking, tucks hair behind ear when nervous, smiles with a slight nervous laugh, uses thumbs-up emoji liberally in texts, often clears throat before speaking in front of adults, shifts weight between feet when waiting. Prefers layered clothes (hoodie + t-shirt), wearing branded athletic sneakers, and carries a medium-sized backpack with stickers: a robotics team sticker, a Korean pop-culture pin, and a NASA logo. Online communicates through short, direct messages, and loves sharing memes and short clips. When stressed, speaks more quietly and avoids eye contact; when excited about a project, speaks rapidly with hand gestures and draws diagrams in the air.",
