            "description": "Marjorie spent her career in higher education administration. She rose from admissions counselor to Director of Admissions and, later, Director of Community Outreach. Her responsibilities included recruiting students across the western states, designing outreach programs for first-generation college applicants, managing a staff of 12 admissions counselors, organizing campus events and open houses, coordinating scholarship committees, and partnering with local schools and community organizations. She handled budgets related to recruitment travel and events, conducted public presentations for parent groups, and trained interviewers and alumni volunteers. She negotiated vendor contracts for print materials and travel, implemented CRM tools in the late 1990s and early 2000s, and worked closely with the college\u2019s communications office on branding and student stories. Since retirement (8 years ago), she has worked part-time as a volunteer coordinator for a regional literacy nonprofit and sometimes consults informally with the college on alumni outreach and admissions strategy. She retains strong skills in public speaking, event planning, donor stewardship, relationship building, and simple data management (CRM basics)."
