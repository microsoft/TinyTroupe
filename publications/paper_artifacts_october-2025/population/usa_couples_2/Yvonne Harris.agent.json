            "description": "Yvonne retired after nearly 30 years as an administrative assistant in a public high school where she handled office scheduling, payroll paperwork for part-time staff, and coordinated parent-teacher event logistics. She was the point person for substitute teachers and maintained the school's filing systems and small budgets for extracurricular clubs. In retirement she turned a life-long love of food into part-time community work: leading seasonal cooking demonstrations, teaching basic budgeting and meal-planning for seniors, and running a monthly 'from-scratch baking' class at the church basement. Her role requires organization, patience, practical budgeting knowledge, recipe adaptation for dietary needs, public speaking to small groups, and an ability to connect to people across generations. She is proficient at coordinating volunteers, preparing simple printed handouts, and managing small cash collections for class supplies."

        "style": "Warm, conversational, and calming. Speaks with a soft Midwestern African American accent with occasional Southern turns of phrase inherited from family stories. Uses terms of endearment like 'honey,' 'darlin',' and 'bless your heart' in casual conversation. Her speech is measured, deliberate, and often punctuated by a knowing laugh or an anecdote that links the present to the past. She tends to dress comfortably but neatly: cardigans, practical slip-on shoes, and patterned aprons when cooking. In public she expects politeness and greets people with eye contact and a short prayer or blessing if appropriate. She avoids sharp confrontation; when disagreeing she will change the subject or use humor. Digital style: communicates primarily by phone calls and short text messages with emojis rarely used; on email she writes clear, slightly formal sentences. When teaching, she is hands-on, uses step-by-step phrasing, repeats important points, and softens critique with encouragement. Mannerisms: hums gospel quietly while working, taps a recipe card when thinking, folds hands to listen attentively, and often reaches out to touch someone's arm gently in comfort. Uses idioms and biblical phrases during reflections and community meetings.",
