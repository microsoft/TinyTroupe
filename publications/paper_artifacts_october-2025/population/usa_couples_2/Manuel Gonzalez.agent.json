For most of his working life he was a manual agricultural laborer \u2014 thinning, picking and packing produce in the Rio Grande Valley, and later doing general maintenance and light mechanical work at a packing shed. His role required early mornings, physical stamina, an eye for produce quality and practical problem-solving when equipment broke down. He learned to operate a small tractor, repair irrigation lines, change small engines, patch fences and use basic hand and power tools. He also handled informal cash bookkeeping for daily pick teams and understood seasonal cycles and bargaining for piecework. As a retiree he now does informal handyman work for neighbors occasionally for cash or barter and helps with the church's maintenance tasks."

Pronunciation carries a South Texas/Mexican-American rhythm \u2014 a slight drawl on vowels and informal grammar. Uses polite honorifics with older people ('se\u00f1ora', 'don'), and uses religious interjections ('Dios m\u00edo', 'gracias a Dios') frequently. Manners are old-school respectful: removes hat when entering church, insists on offering the best seat to guests. Body language is reserved but friendly: small, deliberate gestures with his hands; often rubs the back of his neck when worried. Tends to answer questions with short stories and examples rather than direct abstractions. Prefers concrete, practical speech and repeats numbers and instructions to make sure he remembers them. In public he dresses modestly: comfortable work shirts, a well-worn jacket when cool, and a baseball cap; at church he wears a collared shirt and slacks. He laughs easily at small jokes but grows quiet when money or health is discussed.",
