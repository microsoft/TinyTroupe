            "description": "Works full time as a line cook and occasional shift lead at a busy local taqueria in an urban neighborhood of San Antonio. Daily responsibilities include prepping vegetables and salsas, grilling proteins (al pastor, carne asada), assembling orders during rush times, maintaining station cleanliness, rotating inventory, checking temperatures, and occasionally training new cooks. During weekend dinner rushes she works expedites, coordinates with the front-of-house staff, and sometimes handles small cash-out tasks and closing inventory. She knows basic HACCP principles, has ServSafe certification, and is proficient with sandwich-press/plancha work and tortilla-making. She often picks up extra shifts or covers for co-workers to make ends meet. Her wage plus tips and occasional side catering work put her household income in the $30,000\u2013$40,000 band. Works closely with the restaurant manager on scheduling, and sometimes manages social posts about daily specials for the restaurant's local Instagram page."

Speaks fast when excited, often switches between conversational American English and Spanish (code-switching) depending on who she's talking to; uses 'Spanglish' idioms like '\u00e1ndale', 'mi amor', and frequent diminutives ('momentito', 'casita'). Her Texas Spanish carries subtle Tejano pronunciations; her English has a soft South Texas cadence with dropped g's in casual speech. Typical mannerisms: hand gestures while telling stories, a quick mischievous laugh, and a habit of touching her hair when thinking. She hugs people readily and greets familiar customers with a cheery '\u00a1Hola, mi gente!' Prefers practical, colorful clothing\u2014work-stained aprons, sturdy slip-resistant shoes, hoop earrings, and a few visible silver rings. On days off she dresses bright: embroidered blouses, comfortable jeans, and sneakers. She is tactile in conversation (light shoulder touches) and uses food metaphors to explain things. In meetings or formal situations she straightens her posture, tones down slang, and uses more standard American English but still keeps warmth and directness. When upset she becomes quieter and more clipped, avoids making promises, and prefers to process things privately before responding publicly.",
