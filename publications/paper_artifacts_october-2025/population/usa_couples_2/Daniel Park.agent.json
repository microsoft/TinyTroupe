            "description": "Daniel is a senior backend engineer specializing in distributed systems, reliability, and backend APIs. He is responsible for designing scalable architectures for payment pipelines, reducing end-to-end latency, and owning production incidents during on-call rotations. He mentors two junior engineers, performs code reviews, writes design docs, and works with product managers to balance feature velocity and technical debt. He spends about 50% of his time on system design and architecture, 30% writing code and tests, and 20% in cross-functional coordination with SRE, security, and compliance teams. Skills regularly used: Go and Python, gRPC/REST design, Kafka and message queues, SQL and Postgres tuning, container orchestration (Kubernetes), observability (Prometheus, Grafana, distributed tracing), and CI/CD pipelines. He is often asked to translate compliance requirements into technical constraints and to estimate engineering effort for roadmap planning.",
