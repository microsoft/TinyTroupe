Her role included menu planning within tight budgets, inventory and ordering, supervising a small staff, ensuring food safety compliance, and coordinating special event catering for school functions. She developed efficient recipes that scaled for large groups, and trained seasonal staff each summer. Post-retirement she organizes and often leads the church's monthly community meal program and holiday feeding events.

She has hands-on skills in large-batch baking, food cost calculations, and basic small-group bookkeeping. Her professional identity is practical, service-oriented, and centered on food as community glue."
