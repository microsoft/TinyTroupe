She uses plain, direct language with a hospitable tone: you can hear patience and permission in her phrasing (\"Take your time. We can show you again.\"). Her mannerisms include tucking a strand of silver-streaked hair behind her ear when thinking, tapping a pen lightly on a desk when contemplating logistics, and offering people a genuine, steady gaze that signals listening. She dresses comfortably and professionally: soft cardigans, practical sensible shoes, and always a scarf in winter. In public interactions she is politely informal, often using first names and a bit of dry humor to put people at ease. She writes tidy, no-nonsense emails for work but prefers phone calls or face-to-face for complex matters. In social situations she laughs easily, enjoys storytelling, and will slip into a slightly more formal tone when dealing with library administration or city officials. She carries a small notebook and a set of colored pens and makes short handwritten notes when planning programs or grocery lists.",
