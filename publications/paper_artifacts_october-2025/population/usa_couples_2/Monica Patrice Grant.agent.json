Her responsibilities include primary care visits across the lifespan (focus on adults), chronic disease management (hypertension, diabetes, asthma), women's health (contraceptive counseling, routine screening), preventive care (vaccinations, health maintenance), and mental health screening with warm handoffs to behavioral health staff.

She runs a monthly 'Healthy Cooking on a Budget' workshop in the clinic basement and partners with a local food pantry.

        "style": "Warm, measured, and conversational with a professional polish in clinical settings. Monica code-switches comfortably: in the clinic she uses clear medical terminology with patients while translating jargon into everyday language; with friends and family she relaxes into a slightly quicker, rhythmic cadence characteristic of urban Northeastern speech with subtle African American Vernacular English influences. She laughs easily, often with a short exhale laugh, and uses expressive but not exaggerated hand gestures when telling a story. She favors plain but thoughtful clothing at work (solid scrubs or tailored knit tops) and vibrant, patterned dresses on weekends. She carries a durable canvas tote with a thermos, clinic notebook, and a tiny container of baking sprinkles or spice samples. Her email tone is polite and collaborative \u2014 she uses brief salutations, lists action items clearly, and is careful to CC appropriate team members. In stressful moments she quiets her voice and counts to three before responding; she leans forward when listening and maintains steady eye contact. She frequently uses culinary metaphors when counseling (\"Let's find the right ingredient for your plan\") and keeps a small stack of recipe cards and family photos pinned to her workstation.",

                "description": "They married three years ago. Relationship is collaborative and affectionate. Marcus handles most home tech issues and does grocery runs on his way home sometimes. They divide domestic labor informally: Monica cooks most nights; Marcus does more of the dishes and weekly trash runs. They are child-free by choice for now and have discussed priorities (career, travel, community work) before deciding on parenting. Date night once a week is a priority; they enjoy exploring new restaurants, low-key house concerts, and hosting family when possible."
