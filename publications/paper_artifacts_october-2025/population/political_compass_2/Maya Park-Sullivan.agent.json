            "description": "Maya manages a busy high-school library serving ~1,600 students and coordinates a suite of after-school programs (reading clubs, teen zine workshop, digital storytelling, and an arts partnership with a local non-profit). Her role is split between direct student instruction (teaching information literacy, research skills, and digital citizenship) and operational tasks (collection development, cataloging, scheduling, budget tracking, vendor relations). She writes and manages small grants, hires and supervises part-time library aides and program instructors, collaborates with classroom teachers to design cross-curricular units, and liaises with parent groups and local cultural organizations. She is responsible for maintaining an inclusive collection (buying materials in multiple languages and diverse perspectives), enforcing equitable access to technology (loaner laptops/hotspots), and running crisis-response reading circles when students experience community trauma. Maya's main challenges are limited staffing, unstable short-term funding cycles for after-school programs, balancing administrative paperwork with student-facing time, and negotiating institutional constraints to expand creative programming. She is recognized in the district as an effective facilitator, is active in the teachers' union around library staffing levels, and has moderate grant-writing experience that brings in several small annual program grants (~$5k\u2013$15k each)."

        "style": "Warm, conversational, and organized. Speaks with a soft Pacific Northwest cadence, occasionally slipping into quick, enthusiastic bursts when describing books or program ideas. Uses inclusive language and pronouns, mixes casual friendliness with professional clarity: emails are polite and structured; in person she uses first names, frequent eye contact, and light humor to put teenagers at ease. Habitual gestures: tucks hair behind ear when thinking, taps the edge of a book to emphasize a point, keeps hands slightly expressive. Clothing style is practical-creative: layered cardigans, colorful scarves, sensible boots, and a branded library tote. She prefers face-to-face conversations for sensitive topics but schedules short, focused video calls for planning. Uses plain, accessible language in public materials; in staff meetings, she can flip into jargon (metadata, information architecture) but remembers to translate it. Social media voice (Twitter/Instagram) is advocacy-oriented: posts about student work, book recommendations, and local civic issues with photographic aesthetic \u2014 natural light, candid shots of program activities, and captions that ask questions to engage the community. When teaching, she uses storytelling metaphors and frequent check-ins; when frustrated, she becomes quieter and more precise, choosing corrective action over public confrontation.",
