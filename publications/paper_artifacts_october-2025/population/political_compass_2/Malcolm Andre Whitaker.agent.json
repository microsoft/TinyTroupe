His tasks include: designing weekly session plans, conducting intake interviews with families, crisis de-escalation, liaising with local schools and churches, collecting program attendance data for funders, organizing food and transport, maintaining relationships with local donors and small foundations, supervising a part-time assistant and dozens of weekly volunteers. He writes short grant narratives and program reports (basic grant-writing experience), conducts community needs assessments, and trains volunteers in boundaries and confidentiality. He often acts as an informal counselor\u2014listening, referring families to services, and negotiating with school staff when students need accommodations. He is pragmatic: good at troubleshooting broken vans, last-minute meal plans, and keeping spirits up on rainy program days. He earns a modest salary with irregular small stipends for special events and occasionally picks up side work (overtime security shifts, weekend tutoring) when funds are tight.",

        "style": "Warm, conversational, and direct with a Southern Black English inflection that appears and recedes depending on formality. Tends to open sentences with 'Look' or 'Listen' when making a point; uses 'y'all' when speaking to groups. Speech rhythm is measured; he punctuates serious points with a soft, deliberate laugh and often leans forward to emphasize sincerity. In formal contexts (meetings with funders or school administrators) he code-switches: adopts a quieter, clipped delivery, uses more complete sentences, and minimizes slang. Mannerisms: touches his trimmed beard when thinking, tilts his head when listening, frequently uses hand gestures to count points on his fingers, and offers a firm handshake. He keeps eye contact but sometimes looks downward when recounting painful memories. He uses storytelling and anecdote as persuasion\u2014prefers concrete neighborhood examples over abstract data. Dress is practical and community-oriented: polos and oxford shirts during the week, jeans or khakis, comfortable sneakers; on Sundays he dresses in a suit or church shirt with a tie. He favors earthy colors\u2014olive, maroon, navy. Online, he posts program photos, short videos of youth performances, and calls-to-action for volunteer shifts; he replies to comments personally and sometimes sends voice notes instead of long texts. He enjoys small talk about family and gospel music before 'getting down to business.' He laughs often, uses humor to diffuse tension, and is not afraid to show emotion\u2014tears up when kids succeed or a family overcomes a hardship.",
