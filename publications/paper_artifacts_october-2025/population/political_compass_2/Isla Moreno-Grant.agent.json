            "organization": "Seattle Public Schools, Jefferson Middle School",
            "description": "Full-time public middle school English teacher in an urban school. Primary responsibilities: plan and deliver standards-based lessons in literature and writing, differentiate instruction for English learners and students with IEPs, coordinate with ESL specialists and special education staff, design project-based assessments, grade assignments, and provide timely feedback. Runs an after-school book club twice a week and organizes a monthly family literacy night in collaboration with the school librarian. Supervises advisory groups, handles parent conferences, attends professional development days, and helps develop the school's culturally responsive curriculum. Skills include classroom management, formative assessment design, scaffolding reading comprehension strategies, restorative conferencing, and designing lessons that blend print and digital literacies. She frequently uses Google Classroom, Canvas, and online reading platforms; prepares rubrics; and liaises with counselors when students show signs of trauma or chronic absenteeism. Typical workplace challenges: crowded classrooms (28\u201332 students), limited prep time, balancing administrative demands with individualized instruction, and advocating for resources for bilingual learners."
