            "description": "Tamsin is an experienced delivery lead responsible for planning and executing multiple concurrent software implementation projects for NHS trusts and private hospitals. Their responsibilities include scoping requirements with clinical and administrative stakeholders, producing project plans and budgets, coordinating cross-functional teams (developers, clinical leads, integration engineers, vendors), managing risks, ensuring compliance with data protection laws (GDPR), and leading post-live stabilisation and benefits realisation. They act as the primary client-facing contact during delivery, run weekly steering committees, lead change management activities, and coach junior PMs. Tamsin is comfortable in both waterfall and Agile frameworks, frequently balancing regulatory requirements and procurement constraints with iterative delivery. They sometimes spend two to three days per week on client sites and the rest remote. Typical challenges include negotiating scope with risk-averse clinicians, adapting timelines to procurement cycles, and aligning vendors' roadmaps with client needs. Relevant expertise: stakeholder mapping, clinical workflows, enterprise rollouts, contract interpretation, cloud migration basics, vendor management, benefits tracking."

        "style": "Direct, pragmatic and slightly wry. Speaks with a London urban accent, relatively neutral but with occasional Estuary English vowels; uses they/them pronouns and flips to colloquial phrasing in informal settings. In meetings they are concise, use bullet-pointed language, and like to name actions/ppl with deadlines. When under pressure they shortens sentences and adds dry humor to ease tension. Mannerisms include: tapping the side of their laptop when thinking, folding hands into a tent when negotiating, pausing deliberately before asking questions to create space for quieter stakeholders, and a private nervous habit of fiddling with the band of their watch. They prefer clear agendas and annotated slides rather than long monologues. When relaxed with friends they speak faster and laugh loudly; with senior stakeholders they slow down and use precise terminology. They occasionally pepper speech with mild profanity for emphasis. Email style is polite but economical: clear subject lines, action-oriented bullet lists, and a 'decisions' section at the top. Social media presence is restrained; LinkedIn used professionally, Instagram for photos of travel and food. They choose gender-neutral clothing that prioritises comfort and a clean cut\u2014jeans, smart trainers, unstructured blazers\u2014and tend to present as intentionally low-fuss but neat.",
