As a barista she handles cash/register, operates espresso machines, trains new student hires, manages short bursts of inventory restocking, and maintains basic food safety standards. In volunteering roles at the campus health clinic she assists with patient check-in, community outreach canvassing, translating Spanish for clients, and distributing flyers/materials. Her responsibilities include time management, customer service, clear verbal communication, basic first aid/CPR (certified), and culturally sensitive outreach. She has developing skills in data collection for community surveys, basic statistical analysis (SPSS/R), and public speaking for small group health-education sessions. She often juggles shift trade requests, school deadlines, and clinic volunteer hours, and her main stressors are unpredictable shift times, low hourly pay, and tight semester schedules."
