            "organization": "Tse'yi' Community Center (tribal), and 'Begay Traditions' micro-business",
            "description": "Malia splits her time between part-time paid work at the local community center and running a small home-based craft business. At the community center she coordinates cultural programs: organizes weekly Din\u0000e9 language circle sessions, schedules elders to teach traditional weaving and songs, arranges youth mentorship activities, writes short grant applications for small local funding, and helps plan cultural events (for NA/Indigenous Heritage Days, seasonal ceremonies, and food-sharing gatherings). As a community health outreach worker (part of the center's health outreach grants) she performs basic screenings at events, distributes public-health flyers, assists with vaccination events, and checks on isolated elders via phone and home visits.\n\nFor her small business she produces and sells woven rugs (small rugs and table runners), beaded jewelry, and embroidered items. She markets these at regional markets, a small Etsy shop, and on Facebook Marketplace. She handles all aspects: design, production, photography, order fulfillment, bookkeeping, pricing, and occasional shipping. Her role requires bilingual communication (English and Din\u0000e9), event coordination, basic accounting, community trust-building, simple grantwriting, and practical hands-on craft skills. Her key difficulties are limited time because of childcare, inconsistent cash flow, and navigating tribal and external grant paperwork. She is reliable in person, trusted by elders, and often acts as a mediator between younger families and tribal administrators."

Did not complete an associate's degree due to childcare and work obligations. Has taken numerous local workshops in traditional weaving, beadwork, and Navajo language revitalization.",

        "style": "Warm, reserved, and deliberate. Malia speaks English with a noticeable Southwestern cadence and occasionally slips Din\u0000e9 words and phrases into conversations when she wants to emphasize cultural concepts; she is fully bilingual in practical terms (daily speech, storytelling, and community work) though she sometimes searches for formal vocabulary. She uses a measured, storytelling tone when teaching or recounting history, with a soft laugh and steady eye contact when speaking to people she knows. With outsiders she is polite, somewhat formal at first, and slower to reveal personal details. She smiles easily and uses small physical gestures (touching a bead necklace, tucking hair behind an ear) when thinking. She is indirect when criticizing: prefers to suggest rather than confront; uses metaphors and traditional sayings to teach a lesson. She favors practical clothing: denim, long skirts layered with leggings, sturdy boots or moccasins, and always wears a turquoise or silver piece of jewelry that belonged to a relative. At community events she blends modern and traditional: graphic tee under a woven sash, hair braided, shawl or ribbon skirt for ceremonial occasions. She prefers phone calls for elders, text for peers, and Facebook events for broad community announcements. She often begins conversations with a brief acknowledgment of lineage and place (a Din\u0000e9 custom) which can feel formal to newcomers but anchors her interactions.",
