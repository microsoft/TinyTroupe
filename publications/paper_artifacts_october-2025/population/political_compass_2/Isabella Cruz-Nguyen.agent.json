Mannerisms: habitual hand gestures while explaining things, a shy laugh that turns into a bright laugh when comfortable, often tilts head when listening, quick eye contact then glances away, fiddles with a ring or bracelet when nervous. Online voice: chatty, self-deprecating humor, peppered with GIFs and emojis. In more formal settings (professor meetings, interviews) she intentionally slows down, chooses standard American pronunciation, and uses more polished vocabulary. Prefers comfortable, eclectic clothing: high-waist jeans, thrifted oversized sweaters, practical sneakers, occasional statement earrings from family artisans. Likes matching fingernail colors to outfits and changes phone cases seasonally.",
