In writing, he favors handwritten notes and gentle formality\u2014'Dear,' salutations and closing lines that refer to common sense and decency. When upset, he becomes laconic rather than loud; he avoids profanity. He uses regional idioms (e.g., 'around here,' 'back in the day,' 'you betcha' occasionally), yet avoids strong dialectical markers. He enjoys telling stories and will preface anecdotes with 'I'll tell you what happened\u2026' He dresses plainly: collared shirts, a wool sweater in cold months, sensible loafers, and a winter coat with patched elbows.
