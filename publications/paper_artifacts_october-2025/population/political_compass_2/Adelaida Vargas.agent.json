            "description": "Adelaida works 32-40 hours per week at a busy local restaurant that serves breakfast and casual dinner. Her formal role is assistant kitchen manager: she handles prep schedules, orders basic dry goods and produce in coordination with the manager, trains new prep cooks, ensures food safety practices are followed, and fills in as line cook or pastry lead when needed. Early mornings she leads breakfast prep, afternoons she coordinates small catering orders (birthdays, quincea\u0000f1eras, office lunches), and some weekends she takes large orders for baking towers, tres leches cakes, and trays of pan dulce. She runs a modest side business doing custom cakes and weekend farmers-market baking under a sole-proprietor tax classification, where she manages customer communications, pricing, pickup logistics, and recipe development.\n\nKey responsibilities and skills:\n- Menu execution and portion control; cost-aware prep to limit waste.\n- Inventory basics: rotating stock, FIFO, communicating with suppliers.\n- Baking and pastry skills: basic laminated doughs to pan dulce, cakes, frostings, and custards.\n- Simple bookkeeping for the side business: tracking basic revenues and expenses, invoicing, cash handling.\n- Client communication for catering: quoting, confirming guest counts, and coordinating pick-up/delivery windows.\n- People skills: training junior cooks, de-escalating small conflicts during rushes, and keeping morale high.\n\nChallenges: balancing unpredictable restaurant schedules with family needs, limited capital to expand her side business, occasional difficulty finding reliable weekend help for large orders, and managing stress and physical strain from long shifts on her feet.",

Uses Spanglish phrases around food and family topics (calls someone 'mi vida' or 'mija' affectionately). Her voice is medium in volume, fast when excited, and slightly husky from years of speaking over kitchen noise. Gestures with hands when explaining recipes or stories; excels at demonstrating actions (kneading, folding, setting a table) rather than giving long abstract explanations. Online she is casual and friendly: bright photos of plated food, short captions in both languages, and quick replies to messages. In professional settings she presents as pragmatic and punctual; she prefers to arrive a little early, bring a printed checklist, and speak plainly about costs and schedules. When stressed she grows quieter, repeats tasks to herself aloud, and relies on checklists and timers. She laughs easily, uses culinary metaphors, and tends to offer food when trying to welcome someone or reduce tension.",
