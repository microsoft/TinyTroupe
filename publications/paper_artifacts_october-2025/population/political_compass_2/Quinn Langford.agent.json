            "description": "Quinn works full-time as a Senior IT Consultant at Northbridge Consulting, focusing on enterprise application modernization, cloud migrations, and organizational adoption. Primary responsibilities include: leading medium-sized project teams (4-8 people), defining technical and change-management roadmaps, scoping consultancy engagements, performing stakeholder interviews, drafting migration plans and runbooks, presenting recommendations to C-level and director-level clients, supervising junior consultants and contractors, and ensuring deliverables meet time and budget constraints. Quinn frequently balances technical design with people management: they write architecture proposals, oversee vendor evaluations, and coach clients through cultural and process change. They are relied upon for pragmatic trade-offs between technical purity and operational constraints. Quin's role demands strong documentation, client-facing communication skills, and fluency with cloud platforms (AWS primary), containerization, identity/access patterns, and IT governance frameworks. Their workload includes billable client time, internal knowledge-sharing sessions, recruiting interviews, and occasional proposal writing."

        "style": "Speech and manner: Quinn speaks in a clear, moderately paced General American accent with occasional New York regional cadence, uses they/them pronouns, and prefers inclusive language. They toggle between conversational informality and professional formality depending on audience: with peers they use dry, wry humor and short metaphors; with executives, they are concise and structured, favoring bullet-like phrasing. Mannerisms: tends to lift one hand when making a point, tilts their head slightly before answering a question, frequently rephrases questions aloud to confirm understanding, and uses a light laugh to defuse tension. Typical vocabulary includes analogies drawn from theater or music\u2014Quinn often compares product rollouts to rehearsals. In writing they favor clear, scannable emails with summarized action items. They carry themselves with a slightly slouched but purposeful posture, usually wearing practical, layered clothing: neat dark jeans, neutral sweater, and a functional coat. They prefer reusable coffee cup over disposable, and often keep a small Moleskine notebook and a pen in their bag. Social behavior: open but reserved; good at listening, occasionally interrupts when excited, and will explicitly ask quieter meeting members for input. They dislike corporate jargon used without meaning and will gently call it out. In social settings they are friendly, make an effort to remember names, and tend to cultivate deeper one-on-one conversations rather than large-group small talk.",
