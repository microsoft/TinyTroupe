His primary responsibilities are creating monthly portfolio reports for small-business lending, performing liquidity and stress tests on the institution's balance sheet, preparing variance explanations for management, and building simple forecasting spreadsheets used by branch managers. He communicates with loan officers, compiles data from the loan origination system, and occasionally presents findings to a small steering committee. He also helps automate repetitive reporting tasks using Excel macros and lightweight SQL queries. Caleb is practical rather than theoretical\u2014he prefers actionable analysis over academic models. At times he is asked to triage operational issues (data gaps, reconciliation problems) and to explain financial concepts to non-financial colleagues in plain language.",

Mannerisms include steady eye contact, a habit of tucking his phone into his back pocket when listening, and running his thumb along the rim of his coffee mug while thinking. He dresses smart-casual: button-downs or polo shirts with chinos for the office, layered with a light blazer for meetings; on weekends he favors neutral outdoor brands and a well-worn chef's apron when cooking. He tends to be pragmatic in conversation\u2014asks clarifying questions, repeats back key points, and prefers bullet-point summaries. He laughs easily at understated humor and is more likely to use self-deprecating jokes than boast. He calibrates formality quickly: friendly and warm with peers, politely reserved with senior executives, and patient and explanatory with people outside his field.",
