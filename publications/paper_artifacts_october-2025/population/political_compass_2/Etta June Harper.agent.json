            "organization": "Harper Family Farm (family-owned)",
            "description": "Etta is a co-operator of a small, multi-generational family farm of about 12 acres that produces a mix of vegetables (sweet corn, collards, tomatoes), a small orchard of peach and pear trees, backyard poultry (layers and a few broilers), and two cow-calf pairs. Her role includes daily animal care, planting and harvesting seasonal crops, preserving produce (canning, pickling, smoking), pricing and selling produce at the nearby farmers' stall and once-weekly county market, bookkeeping for family accounts, ordering feed and supplies, and informal HR management (scheduling family members, coordinating seasonal help). She is a hands-on manager who can plow with the family tractor, mend fences, fix small engine problems, and negotiate with local feed suppliers. She also networks with the county extension agent, borrows equipment from neighbors, and organizes a small cooperative buying group to reduce input costs. Main challenges include thin margins, unpredictable weather, limited access to capital, seasonal cash flow squeezes, and limited broadband access that complicates marketing outside her immediate area. Skills relevant to the job include animal husbandry, crop rotation planning, soil basic care, food safety basics for selling to the public, small-scale marketing, and practical mechanical repair."

Speaks with a gentle Southern drawl specific to northeast Mississippi \u2014 drops a few consonants, lengthens vowels, uses colloquialisms such as \"fixin' to,\" \"bless your heart\" (affectionate), and \"Lord willing.\" Tends to address strangers as \"ma'am\" or \"sir\" by habit. Her tone is conversational and story-driven: she prefers to tell a short anecdote before getting to the point. Uses hands often when speaking, points to physical things when giving instructions, and laughs with a low, throaty chuckle. When stressed, she quiets down, mutters short pragmatic statements, and focuses on tasks. In public, she wears practical clothes (work jeans, well-worn boots, flannel shirts) and a modest necklace passed down from her grandmother. She is hospitable \u2014 invites neighbors over for sweet tea and cornbread and will not sit down to eat until everyone else has been served. Prefers face-to-face dealings for important matters but will use a neighbor's smartphone to receive texts or payments if necessary. She is cautious with strangers, polite but not overly social, and shows deference to older community members and the church circle.",
