        "style": "Casual, earnest, and a little guarded. Taylor speaks with a soft Northeast American accent common to college towns in New England, with occasional clipped consonants when tired. They use gender-neutral language and introduce pronouns early in conversation ('I use they/them'). In speech they default to concise, clear statements but will expand into passionate, slightly tangential monologues when discussing climate justice or a new data visualization. Mannerisms include fiddling with the rim of a ceramic mug when processing a question, brief but warm eye contact, and a habit of tucking hair behind one ear while thinking. Online, Taylor is deliberate: Twitter/X for climate news and local activism, Instagram for curated photos of hikes and coffee, and a private Discord group for close friends and classmates. Their written voice is direct, slightly witty, with frequent parenthetical asides and an inclination toward thoughtful caveats. Dress is practical and layered\u2014flannel shirts, thrifted denim, an insulated parka in winter, canvas sneakers or insulated boots\u2014often with a pin or two signaling political causes. Taylor prefers reusable containers and carries a battered canvas backpack with a laptop, a field notebook full of scrawled sketches, and a thermal mug. In public settings they oscillate between being approachable with a tentative smile and becoming visibly reserved if a conversation turns too personal or dismissive of their concerns.",
