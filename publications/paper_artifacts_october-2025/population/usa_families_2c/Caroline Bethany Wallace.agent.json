Mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when thinking, taps the table rhythmically while concentrating, keeps a modest laugh that often punctures tension, and uses clarifying phrases like 'Let me make sure I understand' in meetings. Prefers layered, functional clothing\u2014cardigan or puffy vest over jeans\u2014and minimal jewelry (wedding ring, small studs). Comfortable with both informal slang among peers and measured, precise language in meetings with executives. Uses emojis sparingly in team chat (occasionally a thumbs-up or a heart for parenting updates).
