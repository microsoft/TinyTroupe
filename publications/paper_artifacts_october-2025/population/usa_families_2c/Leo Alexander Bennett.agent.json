            "description": "Leo is currently the primary caregiver for his two young children (ages 5 and 3). Professionally, he trained and worked as an elementary school teacher for six years before shifting to mostly caregiving to accommodate the needs of his young family. He does occasional substitute teaching at a local public elementary school, runs weekend arts-and-crafts workshops at the community center, and teaches seasonal 'nature play' sessions at a nearby park. Responsibilities include lesson planning for his substitute assignments, coordinating activities for toddlers and early-elementary children, leading simple art projects, creating safe, age-appropriate play environments, and handling household logistics like scheduling pediatrician appointments, meal planning, and budgeting. Skills relevant to his occupation: classroom management, early childhood pedagogy, arts facilitation, basic carpentry for setting up play spaces, and parent-teacher collaboration. He balances unpaid household labor with occasional paid community work and is comfortable with steady but modest supplemental income streams (workshops, occasional subbing, craft sales at local markets)."
