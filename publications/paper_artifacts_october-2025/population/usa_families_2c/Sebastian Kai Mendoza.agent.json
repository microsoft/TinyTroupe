            "description": "Works roughly 25 hours per week providing front-line tech support at a local community tech center and teaching basic digital literacy classes for parents and older family members. Responsibilities include troubleshooting Wi-Fi and laptop problems, setting up tablets for families applying for public benefits, maintaining an inventory of donated devices, running beginner workshops (email, Zoom, safety), and supervising a drop-in after-school time occasionally. Also picks up weekend shifts at a local electronics retailer during busy periods (holidays, sales) to supplement income. Role requires practical troubleshooting, patience training adults, basic networking knowledge, inventory tracking, and an ability to explain concepts in plain language. Struggles with irregular hours and limited benefits; hopes to parlay work experience into a steady full-time IT role with benefits or to combine IT skills with child-care training for early childhood tech support roles. Comfortable with Windows, Android, basic routers, Google Workspace and common social apps; not a certified network engineer but very practical and resourceful."
