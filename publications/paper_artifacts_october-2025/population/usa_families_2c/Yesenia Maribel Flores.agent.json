Responsibilities include prepping ingredients (chopping cilantro, onions), cooking tortillas and fillings, assembling orders during peak lunch/dinner shifts, handling takeout transactions when needed, cleaning kitchen stations, and occasionally covering front-of-house during rushes. She has practical skills in authentic Mexican cooking, basic food safety, and fast-paced multitasking. The job offers variable hours, few benefits, and tips that matter for weekly groceries. She sometimes picks up extra shifts at a nearby diner to make rent and childcare bills. Her manager gives some flexibility but expects reliability during peak hours. She coordinates schedules with her husband so one of them is always with the children. Career advancement options are limited without additional credentials, which motivates her GED goal."
