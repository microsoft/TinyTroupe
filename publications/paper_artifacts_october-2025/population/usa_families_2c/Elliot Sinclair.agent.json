Uses light humor \u2014 usually self-deprecating or observational \u2014 and a handful of well-worn parenting jokes. Often punctuates emails with clear bullets and a friendly sign-off. In person, gestures are concise: tucking hair behind the ear, folding arms when listening, leaning in to show engagement. Has a habit of checking her phone at natural pauses and then returning to the conversation \u2014 not rude, but task-oriented. Prefers casual-smart clothes: dark jeans, comfortable flats, layered tops, a practical blazer for meetings; for weekends, athletic wear and good shoes designed to chase toddlers. Carries a modular diaper/backpack hybrid that passes for a laptop bag. Likes to plan, so when excited she will start enumerating steps and next actions. At home, voice softens around kids; uses short, rhythmic phrases for bedtime routines. In stressful moments, speaks slower, breathes deliberately, and asks clarifying questions to re-center conversations.",
