            "description": "Leads a team of 18 engineers across backend, payments integrations, and reliability work. Responsible for roadmaps, hiring and mentorship, cross-team coordination with product and legal, and operational reliability for customer-facing payment flows. Primary metrics include uptime, transaction latency, and time-to-incident-resolution. Regular duties: staffing and interviewing, quarterly planning, writing and defending budget requests, collaborating with product managers and compliance teams, mentoring two direct reports aspiring to staff-level roles. Technical expertise includes distributed systems, service-oriented architecture, observability tooling, and secure payments compliance (PCI awareness). Balances people management with strategic architecture direction; delegates day-to-day hands-on coding but operates a deep technical review role. Typical challenges: scaling reliability as transaction volume grows, prioritizing refactor versus feature work under tight deadlines, and maintaining team morale during on-call rotations. Uses data to argue for investments and is adept at translating complex technical trade-offs for senior leaders and legal teams."
