Responsibilities include supervising two line cooks during the dinner shift, preparing and refining traditional fillings and salsas, baking warm tortillas and occasional pan dulce items, ensuring food-safety and sanitation protocols, rotating inventory, ordering staples with the manager, training junior kitchen staff, and helping plan small catering menus tailored to family budgets. He often arrives early to prep broths, marinate meats, and teach apprentices family recipes. Because it's a family-owned business, he regularly communicates with the owner (an aunt) about menu tweaks and customer feedback. He earns a steady paycheck (household contributes roughly $72,000/year combined), receives limited benefits through the employer (small paid time off, partial health benefits), and sometimes takes on weekend private catering gigs on his own account for extra income.",
