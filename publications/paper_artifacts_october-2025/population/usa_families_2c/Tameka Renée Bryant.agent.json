She teaches basic health education (nutrition, immunizations, postpartum support), conducts home visits for new mothers, and coordinates with social workers and the clinic's pediatric staff. Her role combines case management, community organizing, event logistics, and basic health coaching. Skills used daily include interpersonal communication, empathy, scheduling, light data entry into the clinic's patient portal, volunteer coordination, and basic problem-solving to help families access benefits. She sometimes covers for the pediatric intake desk and helps with translation of clinic materials into plain language for clients with lower literacy levels. Tameka earns in the $33,000u0000$42,000 range annually (consistent with household bracket) and often picks up occasional evening or weekend community events for small stipends."
