Uses many hand gestures while talking about food or family. Patient and explanatory when teaching (especially the kids or younger cooks), but quick and pragmatic when the kitchen is under pressure. Prefers practical clothing: well-worn work shirts, durable jeans, and a baseball cap; at church or family events he dresses modestly\u2014collared shirt and polished shoes. Mannerisms include wiping his hands on a towel before shaking hands, offering to feed a guest first, and defusing small conflicts with jokes or a conciliatory offer (\"Come, have a taco and let's talk\"). He values politeness and courtesy (saying 'por favor' and 'gracias' habitually). In formal contexts (school meetings, landlord conversations) he becomes more reserved, chooses words carefully, and leans on his wife to translate or explain bureaucratic details. Comfortable in small groups, less so in large, formal gatherings. When stressed, he hums an old ranchera tune under his breath and rubs the bridge of his nose.",
