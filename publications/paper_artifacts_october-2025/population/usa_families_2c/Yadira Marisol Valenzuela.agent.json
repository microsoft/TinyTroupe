Main duties include chopping vegetables, preparing breakfast items, assembling simple lunch plates, washing and sanitizing equipment, restocking supplies, and occasionally taking short busser duties when needed.

Receives hourly pay, sometimes tips from regular customers, no stable benefits. Needs flexible scheduling because of childcare. Skills include efficient multitasking in a hot kitchen, basic Mexican cooking techniques handed down from family, and quick improvisation when ingredients are low.
