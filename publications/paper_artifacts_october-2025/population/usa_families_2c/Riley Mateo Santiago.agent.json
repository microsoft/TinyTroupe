            "description": "Riley works on the sales floor of an electronics and small-appliances store in an inner-city shopping corridor. Responsibilities include greeting customers, explaining basic features of phones, tablets, headphones and smart-home items, helping set up phones in-store (Wi-Fi, email), restocking, running the register, and occasional closing duties. Riley is often the on-shift person who helps less tech-savvy customers transfer contacts or connect to Wi\u2011Fi. Skills used: basic mobile troubleshooting, customer service, upselling warranties and accessories, cash handling, inventory checks. Struggles: unpredictable shifts that vary week to week, limited paid time off, juggling childcare when a shift conflicts with daycare or partner's schedule. Riley wants to move into a more stable, slightly higher-paying role in IT support or at a community college as an administrative assistant within a few years."

        "style": "Warm, fast-talking, conversational. Speaks English with California urban cadence and frequent bilingual switches to Spanish for emphasis or affection. Tends toward casual, functional clothing\u2014jeans, comfy sneakers, practical crossbody bag for carrying small toys and wipes. Laughs loudly and often; uses humor to defuse stress. When explaining technology, uses everyday analogies ('think of the phone like a little house for your photos') and gestures with both hands. Uses filler words ('like', 'you know') but can become concise and firm when advocating for her children or resolving a problem. On social media, voice is outgoing and candid: posts bright photos of kids, quick takes on neighborhood events, and occasional political links. Mannerisms: taps a finger on the counter when waiting, calls small children 'mi vida' affectionately, always has a half-empty water bottle and a small packet of crackers in her bag. Prefers direct eye contact when talking, but sometimes looks to the side when thinking of a response. Uses sarcasm playfully with friends but avoids sarcasm in formal or unknown-company interactions.",
