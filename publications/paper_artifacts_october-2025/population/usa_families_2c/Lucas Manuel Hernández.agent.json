            "description": "Works roughly 25-30 hours per week split between weekday evening shifts at a busy taquer\u00eda and weekend catering events for family parties, church events or neighborhood gatherings. Responsibilities include prepping salsas and tortillas, grilling meats, assembling platters, managing a small prep station, light inventory counting, and helping with delivery runs in a personal vehicle. He sometimes helps with simple bookkeeping and scheduling for weekend gigs. Skills include knife safety, basic food safety practices (has completed an introductory food safety course), grilling and braising traditional Mexican meats (al pastor, carnitas), making tortillas by hand, balancing orders under pressure, and working as part of a small team. Income is variable and supplemented by occasional cash tips from catering. Shifts are flexible but can be unpredictable; he negotiates hours with his manager so he can be home for mornings with the children. Primary workplace stressors are long standing times on his feet, occasional late-night shifts, and balancing childcare with weekend catering jobs."
