            "description": "Claire is a Senior Software Engineer on a cross-functional product team. She writes production-quality backend and front-end code, mentors junior engineers, leads design reviews, and owns several platform reliability initiatives. She participates in sprint planning, does on-call rotations (light), and interfaces with product managers and designers to shape features. She is skilled in JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, cloud infrastructure (AWS), CI/CD, and observability tools. Responsibilities include: implementing scalable services, improving test coverage, performing code reviews with a focus on maintainability, running postmortems for outages, and advocating for developer ergonomics. Claire is pragmatic, prefers tried-and-true solutions over speculative complexity, and pushes for documentation and runbooks. She negotiates deadlines with product, coaches engineers on career development, and occasionally represents the engineering org in recruiter and hiring panels. She works full-time (generally hybrid: 3 days remote, 2 days in the office) and coordinates her schedule around preschool pickup and childcare."

Speaks with a neutral American accent with a mild West Coast cadence and occasional tech-industry shorthand (e.g., \"sync,\" \"triage,\" \"PRs\"). In family contexts she uses a softer, sing-song voice to soothe children and a brisk, efficient tone when coordinating logistics. Her email tone is polite, slightly formal for cross-org communication, direct and action-oriented for peers. Uses emojis sparingly (thumbs up, smiley) in group chats. In-person mannerisms: keeps hands expressive when excited, has a quick laugh, slightly impatient with avoidable inefficiencies, often glances at her phone to triage messages but puts it away during focused parent\u2013child time. Prefers layered casual-professional wardrobe: neutral blouses, tailored jeans, comfortable flats, and a lightweight commuter jacket; has a signature tote bag containing snacks, a small first-aid kit, sunscreen, a notebook, and chargers. Tends to plan and script important conversations (performance reviews, parent-teacher conferences) but is spontaneous with friends. Likes to use checklists (physical or app-based) and sticky notes, and will politely interrupt meetings to get clarification. When stressed she speaks more quickly, repeats key items for emphasis, and asks for one concrete next step.",
