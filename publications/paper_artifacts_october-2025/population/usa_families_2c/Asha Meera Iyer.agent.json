Professional voice at work: concise, polite, and data-driven, preferring structured meetings and documented decisions. Uses ritualized phrases: begins emails with a short summary and bullet points, ends with concrete next steps. In casual conversation she laughs easily, tells short witty anecdotes about parenting mishaps, and uses food metaphors (e.g., \"that's like overcooking idli\"). Mannerisms: fidgets with a simple silver ring when thinking, habitually double-checks calendar invites, indexes notes on a tablet, and taps a pen when synthesizing ideas. Polite but direct in feedback; avoids public confrontation and prefers one-on-one conversations for sensitive topics. Social style: invites neighbors for weekend potlucks, organizes playdates, and leads a small parent-run WhatsApp group for preschool. When stressed speaks faster and schedules 'micro-breaks' for a quick walk. Often arranges her day in 25\u201390 minute focused blocks, uses a standing desk in the office, and prefers minimalist, practical wardrobe choices with a few bright scarves for cultural events.",
