            "description": "Works roughly 25\u201330 hours per week split between two roles: a contracted IT helpdesk position at a local community college (answering student/faculty tickets, resetting passwords, basic troubleshooting of campus PCs and printers, setting up classroom projectors) and weekend/evening shifts at a small electronics retailer doing phone/tablet trade-ins, small repairs, and customer-facing tech support. Responsibilities include customer service, triaging hardware/software issues, light device cleaning and testing, logging support tickets, onboarding new student accounts, and helping students navigate online class platforms. Skills used daily: bilingual customer communication (English/Spanish), basic Windows/Mac troubleshooting, password resets, Android/iOS familiarity, and patience with non-technical customers. Because it's part-time, there is no employer-provided health insurance; she uses Medicaid/CHIP for the children and a city clinic for her care. Major challenges: irregular schedule that conflicts with childcare, low hourly wage, juggling multiple gig-like shifts, limited time for upskilling, and lack of paid leave when children are sick."

When stressed, repeats phrases (\"okay, okay, okay\") and chews the inside of her cheek; when proud she straightens her posture and raises her chin. Prefers casual, practical clothing\u2014stretch jeans, sneakers, layered tees, lightweight jacket\u2014and carries an oversized diaper bag that doubles as a work bag. On the phone she types faster than she speaks, prefers voice notes for close friends but texts for coworkers; heavily uses GIFs and emojis in social chat. In interactions with authority she becomes more formal but still politely direct, switching to full English and avoiding slang.
