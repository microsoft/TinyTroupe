He supervises a crew of 3-6 men on site, reads blueprints, estimates materials, writes punch lists, and coordinates with suppliers and homeowners. He spends much of the week in the field (6:30 AM start), handles client-facing discussions about budget and scope, ensures safety compliance, mentors two junior carpenters/apprentices, operates a set of power tools and light equipment, and jumps in to do specialized finish work when needed. He does invoicing and simple bookkeeping for his foreman jobs and tracks material costs. Annual household income from payroll and side projects falls in the mid $60k\u2013$85k range combined with occasional weekend paid small jobs.",

Tends to address people politely but directly (sir/ma'am with older neighbors; first names with coworkers). Habitually rolls up sleeves, smooths his cap brim, and rubs the back of his neck when thinking. Dresses practically: worn-but-clean work jeans, flannel shirts in cooler months, branded heavy boots, a baseball cap with a local hardware or church logo. At home prefers relaxed practical clothes: polos, sweatshirts, and canvas slippers. Manners: opens doors for his spouse, insists on table manners for the kids, and uses a firm-but-warm voice for instructions. He rarely uses slang-heavy social media language and prefers phone calls or face-to-face. In meetings he listens for a beat before speaking, speaks in short paragraphs, and uses concrete examples rather than abstractions. Laugh is a low chuckle; when annoyed gets quiet for a minute then explains directly. He often ends conversations with a comment about the weather, the kids, or the church potluck.",
