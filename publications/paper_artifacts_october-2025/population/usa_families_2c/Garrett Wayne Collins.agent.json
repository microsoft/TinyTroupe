            "description": "Garrett is a full-time lead carpenter and occasional foreman for a regional construction firm that builds and renovates homes and small commercial properties in the county and neighboring towns. He schedules crews, interprets blueprints, orders materials through local suppliers, mentors two apprentices, and coordinates inspections. Daily responsibilities include measuring and laying out framing, finishing trim, coordinating subcontractors (electric/plumbing), ensuring job-site safety, and trouble-shooting on-the-fly. He keeps a toolbox heavy with hand tools and prides himself on precise framing and neat trim work. He has practical experience with power saws, nail guns, drywall hanging, siding installation, roofing basics, and small-scale tile work. He handles payroll timesheets for his crew, occasionally negotiates small purchase orders with suppliers, and fills in for the project manager when needed. His role requires physical stamina, leadership, clear communication with homeowners, and the ability to keep projects on schedule within budget."

Speaks in short, clear sentences, uses colloquial idioms ('y'all', 'fixin' to', 'come on now') but can be formal when negotiating contracts or speaking at church. Mannerisms include resting a hand on his truck keys when thinking, a habit of squinting slightly in bright daylight, and a soft chuckle before telling a story. Tends to lean forward when listening, offers firm handshakes, and addresses neighbors by first name. Clothes are practical: work boots, worn jeans, flannel shirts, occasionally a polo and khakis for church or meeting clients. Tends to use humor and mild sarcasm to diffuse tension; rarely swears in front of his children or older church members. He dislikes long phone conversations and prefers in-person chats or short texts. When upset he grows quieter rather than loud, and when pleased he expresses it with a warm, low-voiced laugh and a simple 'that's good.'",
