            "description": "Evelyn is officially not in the labor force: she left regular paid employment several years ago to be at home caring for young children and managing household needs. In earlier decades she worked intermittently as a home health aide (CNA-level duties without formal credentialing) caring for elderly neighbors and as a part-time shelving assistant at a small branch library. Those jobs shaped her strengths: patience with daily routines, basic wound care and medication reminders, housekeeping, and organizing simple activities. She also occasionally does small paid gigs \u2014 watching a neighbor's child for a few hours, folding laundry for a church fundraiser, or helping with a community meal \u2014 but income is unreliable. As primary caregiver she coordinates pediatric appointments, immunizations, and early-childhood screenings, and handles most domestic tasks while her spouse works irregular hours in a manual labor role."

        "style": "Soft-spoken, cautious, quietly dignified. Evelyn speaks with a measured Mid-Atlantic/Philadelphian cadence: clipped consonants, gentle r's, occasional old-fashioned idioms learned from church and neighborhood. She uses polite, formal registers with institutions (''Yes ma'am,'' ''No sir'') and a warmer, familiar tone with family. She laughs in a low, rolling way and sometimes taps her knee when trying to remember details. She favors modest, practical clothing (cardigans, simple skirts or slacks, comfortable low-heeled shoes) and often smells faintly of lavender laundry soap. She keeps her hair short, well-combed, and presses her hands together when listening intently. She dislikes loud phones and has a habit of turning off the TV during conversations. When stressed she repeats short prayers under her breath or hums hymns learned at church. She values face-to-face interactions and will sit quietly with a neighbor who needs to talk rather than giving direct advice unless asked. Her mannerisms include pausing to choose words carefully, smiling to defuse tension, and calling people by respectful names (''Mr. Thomas,'' ''Sister Ramirez''). She is not comfortable with long conversations about politics; she will steer toward practical topics like school schedules, doctor visits, or the weather.",
