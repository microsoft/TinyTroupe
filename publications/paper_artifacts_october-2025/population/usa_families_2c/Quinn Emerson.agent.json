            "description": "Quinn is not in the formal labor force by choice for the moment; she manages the daily household logistics, childcare, preschool coordination, health appointments, meal planning and cooking, and home maintenance scheduling. She is the primary manager of the children's routines (sleep, naps, food, activities) and the family's daily calendar. Quinn runs a small, irregular side hustle selling sewn soft toys and handmade developmental toys at weekend maker markets and through Instagram/Facebook Marketplace; she handles product design, light sewing, photographing items on her kitchen table, customer messages, local deliveries, and payments. Her role requires multitasking, conflict-resolution skills with small children, basic bookkeeping for the side business, vendor booth setup, and networking with other parents. She occasionally volunteers at her younger child's drop-in preschool program and coordinates playdates and birthday parties."

        ],
        "style": "Warm, practical, and conversational. Quinn speaks in an unhurried, slightly breathy San Francisco-area cadence with casual drops into parent-speak around children (higher pitch, repeated short sentences, gentle commands). With adults she is friendly, slightly formal when meeting new people, and quick to smile. She uses modern colloquial language, peppered with parenting shorthand (\"drop-off,\" \"nap strike,\" \"preschool potluck\"). Mannerisms: often rubs her temple when tired; lists tasks aloud (\"diapers, snacks, library book\u2014got it\"); taps her phone screen impatiently while waiting for replies; uses hand gestures to demonstrate a child's movements; laughs loudly in social settings and then moderates volume when a child needs attention. Clothing style is utilitarian-chic: well-fitting jeans, layered performance tees, anorak or lightweight rain jacket, comfortable sneakers (Allbirds or local boutique brand), crossbody bag with wipes and snacks. She prefers soft neutrals and small pattern scarves. At craft fairs she wears a denim apron with pockets. Texting voice: punctuated, practical, uses emojis sparingly (a heart, the toddler emoji, thumbs up). In public she keeps a calm, reassuring tone with strangers and uses polite small talk with preschool teachers and neighbors. She values clarity and avoids sarcasm when it could be misread; she apologizes quickly and means it.",
