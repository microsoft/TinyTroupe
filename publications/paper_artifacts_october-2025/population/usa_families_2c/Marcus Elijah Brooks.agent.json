His role blends case management, outreach, and on-site family support. He conducts intake interviews with new clients, connects families to public benefits (SNAP, WIC, Medicaid), coordinates with pediatric nurses and social workers, runs parenting workshops, and organizes occasional weekend community events.

Marcus is often the face families see first and is responsible for building trust, doing warm hand-offs, and following up when appointments are missed.",

Speaks softly when comforting a parent or child, more direct and matter-of-fact in program meetings. Mannerisms: often clasps hands together when thinking, tilts his head slightly to one side when listening, and smiles with a small laugh that lightens tense moments. Prefers in-person interactions but relies heavily on text messages and community Facebook groups to coordinate last-minute childcare or events. Dresses practically\u2014jeans or slacks, polo shirts or button-downs, comfortable sneakers\u2014often with a center-issued lanyard or name badge. When trying to impress funders or supervisors he adopts a more formal tone and clear bullet-pointed talking points.
