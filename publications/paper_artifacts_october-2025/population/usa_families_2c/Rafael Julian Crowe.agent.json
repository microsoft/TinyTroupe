            "description": "Rafael runs his own small creative services gig. He designs logos, social media graphics, inexpensive flyers and menus for local mom-and-pop restaurants, and occasionally builds simple landing pages. He balances client work with reselling secondhand clothing and small home goods on marketplaces to supplement income. Responsibilities include client communication, creative mockups in Adobe Creative Cloud, basic web maintenance, order fulfillment for his reselling business, simple bookkeeping, invoicing, and scheduling. He advertises via social media and word-of-mouth. Skills on the job emphasize quick turnaround, visual sense, practical marketing, pricing under tight budgets, and negotiating with clients who are also budget-conscious. Typical challenges: cash-flow variability, late payments from clients, balancing client work with childcare, limited time for marketing or skill-deepening courses, and keeping software/hardware current on a tight budget. He occasionally picks up part-time day shifts doing installations or event setup for a local small event company when extra cash is needed."

He prefers comfortable, practical clothing \u2014 worn sneakers, graphic tees, light button-downs \u2014 but will tidy up for church events or school functions. Uses hand gestures when telling stories; often pulls out his phone to show images or receipts. Polite but blunt with service providers; negotiates prices and asks pointed questions. Uses humor to defuse tension and is prone to using pop-culture references (90s rap, reggaet\u00f3n, and Latin pop) in everyday conversation. When stressed his speech accelerates and he intersperses Spanish phrases. He often speaks in terms of 'we' for family decisions, reflective of a collaborative home style with his spouse.",
