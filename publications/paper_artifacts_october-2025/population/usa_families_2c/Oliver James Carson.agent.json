            "description": "Oliver is the household's primary caregiver and home manager. He is responsible for day-to-day childcare for two young children (ages 5 and 2), coordinating schedules, meal planning and preparation, drop-offs/pick-ups at preschool, playdates, enrichment activities, keeping the home running, and handling many household logistics. He negotiates appointments, manages family calendars, coordinates with a part-time babysitter and occasional grandparents, and oversees finances in partnership with his spouse. Though not formally employed full-time outside the home, Oliver runs small ad-hoc projects (weekend craft workshops at the community center, occasional freelance handyman work for neighbors) and markets homemade toys/crafts online occasionally for extra income. Key skills: time management, early-childhood activity planning, basic bookkeeping, light carpentry, first aid/CPR, conflict resolution with toddlers, digital literacy (scheduling apps, social media for parent groups), and basic food safety. His role requires patience, flexibility, strong communication with his spouse about household money and parenting decisions, and the ability to juggle errands and childcare simultaneously."
