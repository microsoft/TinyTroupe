Strong focus on reliability, data privacy, and developer experience. Techniques and skills: distributed systems fundamentals, Python/Go, SQL, Docker/Kubernetes, CI/CD pipelines, pragmatic trade-offs between speed and technical debt.

Uses analogies drawn from software engineering when explaining everyday things to adults (e.g., 'Let's iterate on our bedtime routine' or 'think of this as a feature flag for screen time'). To friends she is colloquial and uses playful sarcasm; at work she is professional, concise, and slightly formal in written communication (well-structured emails, annotated PR comments). Mannerisms: rarely raises her voice, frequently pauses to ask clarifying questions, tilts her head and smiles when a child says something surprising. In social situations, she tends to initiate introductions and then focus on 2\u20133 deeper conversations rather than circulate widely. Dress is functional-professional on workdays (clean jeans, blazer, comfortable shoes) and relaxed athleisure on weekends (running leggings, breathable tops). Has a habit of tucking hair behind her ear when concentrating, and carries a large daypack that contains snacks, a small toy kit, laptop, reusable water bottle, and a folding baby carrier. Prefers face-to-face meetings for sensitive topics, but relies on Slack and calendar blocks to preserve boundaries.",
