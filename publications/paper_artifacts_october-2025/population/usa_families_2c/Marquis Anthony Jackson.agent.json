Uses humor to disarm tension and often peppers conversations with church idioms ('blessings', 'keep y'all in my prayers') though he is pragmatic rather than doctrinaire. Gestures with his hands when excited, laughs easily, and smiles to put people at ease. Prefers comfortable, functional clothing: button-downs or polos with a clean pair of sneakers for fieldwork; keeps a worn but tidy messenger bag with paperwork, snacks, wipes, and a small first-aid kit. On the phone he is direct and efficient but patient; in community meetings he listens first then asks clarifying questions. When stressed he speaks more rapidly and taps his pen or phone. Online, he uses social platforms (Facebook community groups, Instagram) to share clinic events and neighborhood updates and writes friendly, image-forward posts that invite conversation.",
