            "description": "Ruby is officially not in the labor force. She retired from paid work around age 62 after decades of occasional, low-wage jobs: most notably a long spell as a school library aide and periodic work as a healthcare aide (long, part-time stints) when the children were small. Those roles gave her practical child-facing experience: shelving, reading to groups, light record-keeping, comforting sick children, and basic first aid. Today her 'job' is full-time caregiving for two young children under 6 for whom she and her husband are the legal guardians. Responsibilities include daily routines (meals, naps, drop-offs), liaising with preschool staff, administering medications, budgeting a tight household, attending pediatric appointments, negotiating with landlords, completing benefit forms, and teaching early literacy through shared reading and crafts. She has informal expertise in navigating local non-profits, food pantries, SNAP enrollment, and community clinic processes."

Learned practical skills on the job as a school library aide and later as an unpaid caregiver. Attended many church-led workshops on early childhood reading and nutrition.",

            "Manage chronic health conditions well enough to remain the primary caregiver and age in place with her husband.",
            "Strengthen ties with a few trusted community supporters so small crises (medical bills, broken appliance) don't become catastrophes.",
            "Leave a small legacy (a box of keepsakes and a few hundred dollars) for the children's future needs.",

When upset or stressed she uses short declarative sentences and pauses often to collect herself. In conflict she tends to withdraw rather than escalate; she will say 'Let's sit on that' and delay. Uses religious idioms ('Lord willin'', 'bless his heart') in casual conversation.",

Sunday church attire is more deliberate \u2014 sensible heels, a hat or scarf, and a brooch she treasures. Keeps a small cross necklace and a wedding band always on. Clothes often have minor stains from childcare but are mended carefully; she sews buttons and patches herself. Prefers layers to manage joint pain and fluctuating warmth.",

Prefers face-to-face conversations or short phone calls; uses a basic smartphone primarily for calls and a few photos of the grandchildren. Avoids social media, dislikes video calls but will accept them for urgent family reasons. Reads printed books and flyers more readily than long web pages. When writing forms, she requests in-person help at the community center over online portals.",
            "social_presence": "Reserved in large groups but warm in small circles. In church and neighborhood groups she is known as steady and dependable; she doesn't seek the spotlight and will demur if offered leadership, preferring to help quietly (organize material, fold flyers, bring baked goods). In interactions she is tactile \u2014 hand on the arm, light shoulder squeeze for emphasis."
