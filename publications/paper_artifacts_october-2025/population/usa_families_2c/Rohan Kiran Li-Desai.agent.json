Mannerisms: taps a knuckle when thinking, keeps a small notebook for quick sketches and architecture diagrams, laughs with a soft exhale, and often gestures with his right hand when explaining technical concepts. In parenting situations he uses calm, explanatory language, prefers positive reinforcement, and is quick to diffuse tantrums by distraction and singing silly made-up songs. Socially he is warm but reserved at large parties\u2014engages deeply in small groups. He prefers lists and schedules, often sends summarized follow-up messages after meetings, and values punctuality. Clothing: professional-casual \u2014 well-fitted chinos, button-down shirts, and smart sneakers; at home relaxes into soft hoodies and slip-on shoes. Communication habits: uses brief Slack threads for async decisions, writes clear RFCs, texts his spouse cute check-ins during the day, and keeps an active shared family calendar.",
