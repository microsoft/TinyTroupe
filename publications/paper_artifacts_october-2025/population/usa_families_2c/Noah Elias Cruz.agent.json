Dresses practically: comfortable hoodies, worn denim, sneakers, and a few graphic tees referencing video games. Keeps a practical, slightly cluttered phone case with stickers (game logos, subway pass) and a backpack with charging cables, multitools, and snacks. Online voice is energetic and meme-laden; in-person, he's tactile\u2014often ruffling his toddler's hair in mid-conversation.
