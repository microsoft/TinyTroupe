            "description": "Diego works about 25-30 hours per week as a line cook at a busy neighborhood taqueria in an inner-city Houston neighborhood. His duties include prepping salsas and fillings, grilling and managing a small comal station, assembling tacos and tortas during peak lunch and dinner service, maintaining basic inventory counts, and practicing food-safety protocols learned in a short community course. Evenings and some weekend mornings he takes small catering orders and bakes pan dulce, empanadas, and tres leches cupcakes that he sells by word-of-mouth and at occasional weekend church events. He manages orders via text messages and Facebook community posts, handles small cash-and-Card transactions, and coordinates pickup times with customers. Skills: basic food safety, knife skills, grilling/comal technique, dough and pastry basics, portioning, speed multitasking in busy service, and simple bookkeeping to keep track of orders and costs. He has experience negotiating with local produce vendors and recycling containers between shifts. Biggest challenges: irregular hours, lack of benefits, juggling childcare around shifts, and limited time for administrative work for his small catering operation."

        "style": "Warm, practical, and colloquial; bilingual Spanish-English code-switcher. Speaks with a Houston urban accent when in English and fluent Mexican regional inflections when speaking Spanish (uses terms like \"mija/mijo,\" \"abuela,\" \"cuate\" casually). Conversational tone: expressive hands, laughs loudly when comfortable, uses food metaphors to explain things. Often softens statements with \"\u00bfsabes?\" or \"\u00bfverdad?\" when asking for agreement. Prefers direct but gentle politeness \u2014 will say \"gracias, amigo\" or \"bendito\" to express gratitude. In public interactions with service staff, he is generally patient but keeps tone firm if something goes wrong. When stressed he speaks faster, more clipped, and uses short declarative sentences. He greets neighbors and family with a warm, lingering handshake or hug. Mannerisms: tucks a napkin into his back pocket or apron, fiddles with a ring on his left hand when thinking, hums traditional ranchera or norte\u00f1o tunes while cooking, and often checks his phone for texts or community group posts while waiting for simmering or baking times. In formal settings (school meetings, clinic visits) he becomes more reserved, using more standard English and attentively taking notes on his phone. He uses social media (Facebook community groups and WhatsApp) as his main communication channels for family and small-business contacts.",
