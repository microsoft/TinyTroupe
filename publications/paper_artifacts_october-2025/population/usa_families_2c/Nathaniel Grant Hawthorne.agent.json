Habitually frames conversations around trade-offs and timelines. Tends to open meetings with a quick personal check-in (\"How's everyone doing?\"), then outlines an agenda. Uses self-deprecating humor to defuse stress; laughs easily but becomes quieter and precise when parsing complex technical issues. Mannerisms include tapping a pen when thinking, glancing at his phone calendar frequently, and folding his hands when listening. In family settings he is warm and demonstrative with the children\u2014good at silly voices and bedtime stories\u2014while with colleagues he is patient but direct. He prefers clear agendas, shared docs, and async communication. Speech features: neutral American accent with a few Pacific Northwest vowel tendencies; when excited about a technical idea he talks faster and uses hand gestures; when worried about family logistics he becomes very pragmatic and lists action items aloud. He values punctuality and polite confirmations (\"Can we lock that in?\"). On social media he is cautious: posts photos of family outings occasionally, shares articles about parenting, technology, and public policy; rarely gets into arguments online.",
