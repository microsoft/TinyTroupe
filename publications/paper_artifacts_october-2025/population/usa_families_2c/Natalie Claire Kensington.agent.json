Prefers conversational directness over small talk in professional settings; uses humor to defuse tension. When tired (often after disrupted nights with kids) her sentences shorten and she becomes more literal. Dresses in smart-casual clothing: neutral-colored blouses, comfortable trousers, practical shoes; at playgrounds she swaps to jeans and sneakers quickly. Likes layered outfits that work for office, daycare drop-off, and toddler wrangling. Carries a medium tote with laptop, snack stash, a small notebook, kids' snacks, and a spare shirt. Communicative style online: responsive on Slack during work hours, prefers threads and short summaries; on social media posts thoughtful, photo-forward family updates, and occasional policy commentary about childcare and urban planning.",
