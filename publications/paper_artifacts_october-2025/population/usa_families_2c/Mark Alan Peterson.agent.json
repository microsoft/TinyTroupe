He is a lead carpenter with supervisory responsibilities: scheduling crews of 3u0010 people, ordering materials, ensuring job-site safety, quoting smaller jobs for the company, coordinating with suppliers, and mentoring two younger apprentices. His role requires hands-on labor most days but also administrative tasks: filling daily job logs, managing invoices and change orders, and communicating with homeowners. He has about 20+ years of practical experience; his strengths are on-the-ground problem solving, measuring and laying out complex trim work, and field leadership. He is comfortable reading blueprints for typical residential work, negotiating with subcontractors (plumbers/electricians), and doing quality control on finishing work. He usually works 45u001055 hours per week, with overtime during peak seasons. Annual household income falls within the $50,000u0010$99,999 bracket depending on busy seasons and extra weekend jobs.",
