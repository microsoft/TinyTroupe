Responsibilities include prepping vegetables, assembling simple breakfast plates, maintaining station cleanliness, monitoring inventory of staples, basic food safety, occasionally covering for servers during rushes, and warming items for grab-and-go orders. She picks up occasional extra shifts at another nearby cafeteria or does one-off catering prep on weekends for extra cash. Skills required: fast-paced multitasking, basic knife skills, following written recipes, communicating with head cook, and adapting traditional family recipes to diner portions. She has no formal culinary diploma but learned much from family and on-the-job training. Main friction points: unpredictable hours that conflict with childcare, low hourly pay (near minimum wage), no benefits, and lack of stable predictable schedule."
