Dresses casually: jeans, hoodies, branded sneakers, and sometimes a baseball cap. At work puts on a slightly more professional tone (clearer enunciation, fewer slang terms). On social media he curates a lively persona \u2014 posts family photos, gaming clips, and neighborhood food finds. Mannerisms include checking his phone frequently, tapping the top of his head when thinking, and a habit of starting conversations with a laugh or nickname. He apologizes quickly if he bumps into people and uses small rituals to calm himself (chewing gum, deep breaths).",
