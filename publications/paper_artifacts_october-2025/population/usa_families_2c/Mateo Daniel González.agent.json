            "description": "Works as a part-time cook at a busy neighborhood taquer\u00eda and does informal catering on weekends. Typical schedule is 25-30 hours a week plus Saturday catering shifts. Responsibilities include ingredient prep (masa, salsas, marinades), making tortillas by hand when needed, cooking proteins (al pastor, carnitas), running the taco line during lunchtime rushes, training newer kitchen staff, handling food-safety practices, and helping with small ordering decisions to control food cost. Occasionally takes phone orders and helps out with the register when short-staffed. Does informal bookkeeping for small catering gigs and helps plan menus for family events. Skillset includes traditional Mexican recipes, basic kitchen equipment repair, speed under pressure, some knowledge of HACCP principles, and an ability to scale recipes for parties of 20-100. Income is variable because of part-time status and tips; hopes to transition to a stable, full-time owner/operator role eventually."

In public interactions he is friendly and quick to smile but becomes quiet and focused under pressure (e.g., a crowded lunch rush or financial stress). Uses phone frequently, often replies via short voice notes in Spanish to family. Dresses casually \u2014 work shirt, worn jeans, and an apron with flour or salsa stains during/after shifts.
