            "description": "Katherine is a senior software engineer and tech lead responsible for a 6-person team that builds parts of a cloud-native platform. Her responsibilities include technical design reviews, mentoring engineers, sprint planning, coordinating with product managers, and contributing hands-on code for core backend services (primarily Python and Go). She spends about 40% of her time on managerial/coordination tasks and 60% on hands-on engineering and architecture. Skills required: distributed systems fundamentals, API design, automated testing, CI/CD pipelines, cloud infrastructure (AWS/GCP), and team leadership. She balances shipping reliable features with coaching junior developers toward better coding and testing practices. Typical work difficulties: meetings that fragment deep work time, balancing product deadlines with technical debt, negotiating cross-team priorities, and arranging childcare coverage when travel is required for work."

        "style": "Clear, measured, and friendly. Speaks with a mild West Coast American accent with slight upward inflection typical of Bay Area professionals. Uses concise technical language at work but softens tone with humor and empathy around family topics. Mannerisms: often tucks hair behind her ear when thinking, taps her index finger on a table when constructing an explanation, and uses hand gestures to diagram ideas. She prefers plain, functional clothing\u2014well-cut jeans, knit tops, a light coat in cooler months\u2014and keeps a tidy but practical appearance. In meetings she tends to be collaborative, asks clarifying questions, and repeats action items aloud to confirm. With friends she uses informal, playful expressions and shares parenting anecdotes readily; with elders she is respectful and slightly formal. She relies on quick SMS or Slack messages for logistics and email for formal communications. When stressed, she speaks faster and uses more imperative phrasing; when relaxed, she tells longer stories with detailed examples. She enjoys light sarcasm in private groups but avoids it in professional settings where it could be misunderstood.",
