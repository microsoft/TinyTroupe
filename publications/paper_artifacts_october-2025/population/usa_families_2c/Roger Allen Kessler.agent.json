He coordinates day-to-day job scheduling, reads blueprints, keeps safety logs, orders parts, trains apprentices, and handles client-facing communications on site. He still climbs ladders and runs conduit on more demanding tasks but primarily manages the crew and quality control. He handles invoicing for projects occasionally, keeps track of timesheets, and liaises with general contractors. His role requires practical problem solving, hands-on technical skill, knowledge of local code, and steady, reliable supervision. He has a truck and trailer with tools and is on-call some weekends for small-town emergency work. Benefits include health insurance through the company, modest 401(k) contributions, and paid time off that he uses sparingly.",
