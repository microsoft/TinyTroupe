Mannerisms include pushing up his glasses when thinking, tapping a finger when considering options, and a habit of saying 'okay, sounds good' to summarize agreement. He uses emojis sparingly in texts (thumbs up, folded-hands), prefers calendar invites and Slack threads for logistics, and has an eye for functional, low-key style: tidy sweaters, performance chinos, neutral sneakers, and a few traditional kurtas for festivals. He values punctuality, responds promptly to messages during work hours, but keeps evenings reserved for family most days.
