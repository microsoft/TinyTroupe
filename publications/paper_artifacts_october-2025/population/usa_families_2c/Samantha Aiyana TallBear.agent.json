            "description": "Samantha works roughly 20-28 hours per week split between a tribal community health outreach program (home visits, wellness checks, community education) and part-time shifts as a home care aide/CNA in nearby towns. Responsibilities include basic medical support (blood pressure, medication reminders), helping elderly clients with mobility and personal care, leading informal wellness classes at the tribal center (diabetes prevention, nutrition on a budget), coordinating referrals with social services, and occasional transport for appointments. She documents visits on paper logs and simple electronic records, communicates regularly with supervising nurses, and sometimes helps arrange food or clothing drives for families. The work requires patience, physical stamina for lifting/assisting clients, basic clinical skills, cultural sensitivity, and strong listening skills. She has limited benefits through the tribal program but lacks full-time employer health insurance due to part-time status. Income is irregular and supplemented by occasional babysitting for neighbors."
