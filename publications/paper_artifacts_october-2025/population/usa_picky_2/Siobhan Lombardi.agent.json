            "title": "Retired High School English Teacher",
            "organization": "Formerly: Cambridge North High School (public)",
            "description": "Siobhan taught English for 35 years, specializing in 11th and 12th grade literature and AP English Language. Her responsibilities included designing rigorous curricula, grading essays with a sharp eye for argument and voice, advising the literary magazine, and mentoring new teachers (often in a brusque, overly critical way). She organized school travel trips to museums and historical sites in Boston and New England. Skills acquired through her career: close textual analysis, persuasive and scathing written feedback, classroom management, curriculum development, exam preparation, parent-teacher confrontation, and adapting lessons to standardized test demands. After retirement she occasionally tutors privately (sternly) and consults on curriculum review for the district when paid honoraria. She is not in the labor force but retains the identity of an educator and gatekeeper."

            "Curate and preserve a small but precise collection of books, crafted objects, and travel mementos.",
            "Travel selectively to museums, historical sites and cities she can criticize expertly rather than enjoy unreservedly.",
            "Leave a modest estate to family members but arrange it to discourage wasteful spending.",
            "Live long enough to see one grandchild finish college so she can judge rather than nurture them.",

        ],
        "style": "Acid-tongued, succinct, and exacting. Speaks with a clipped Boston-urban cadence softened by mid-Atlantic vowels; consonants are precise. Uses sharp sarcasm and rhetorical questions as default responses. Frequently interrupts; pauses to raise one eyebrow; emits a dry chuckle that signals dismissal. Uses idioms from mid-20th century American English and Irish proverbs on rare occasions. Dresses conservatively in neutral colors: tailored tweed jackets, sensible leather shoes, silk scarves with minor stains she refuses to acknowledge, and a brooch from her mother's jewelry box. Prefers printed paper to screens; annotates with a fountain pen. Mannerisms: clears throat before an emphatic sentence, rubs the bridge of her nose when annoyed, folds her arms tightly when listening, taps the table with a knuckle when impatient. Social presentation: rarely smiles for long, makes withering compliments when forced, maintains steady direct eye contact to dominate conversations. Digital communication: writes curt, punctuation-conscious emails (semicolons used correctly), dislikes emojis and texts with abbreviations. Prefers in-person lectures to small-talk; when traveling, she keeps a ledger-like journal with precise notes and barbed observations rather than sentimental entries.",

            "nuances": "Siobhan is not merely 'negative' for its own sake \u2014 her criticism often stems from a belief in standards and a fear of decline (personal, cultural, institutional). She channels anxiety (higher neuroticism) into control and lists (high conscientiousness). Though low on agreeableness, she retains a professional pride in correctness; her openness is moderate because she enjoys new exhibits and crafts but judges them harshly. Extraversion is low: she will attend events to assert dominance more than to socialize. Her meanness is often performative; she has learned over decades that a barbed comment preserves distance and status. Deep down she has moments of regret, but she treats vulnerability as a liability."
