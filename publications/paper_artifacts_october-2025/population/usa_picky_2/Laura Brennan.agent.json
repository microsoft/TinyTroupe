            "organization": "Large urban medical center (tertiary hospital in Boston metro area)",
            "description": "Laura is a senior RN with responsibilities that blend clinical oversight, unit-level quality improvement, staffing coordination, and mentoring of less experienced nurses. She supervises a team of charge nurses, oversees compliance with clinical protocols (especially in geriatric and post-op care), facilitates morbidity-and-mortality reviews, and runs monthly in-service training sessions. She handles scheduling conflicts, enforces standards for documentation, and routinely pushes back on administrative initiatives that she deems impractical. Skilled at triage, wound assessment, medication reconciliation, and escalation to physicians when required. Comfortable with charting systems but skeptical of EMR-driven workflow changes that sacrifice clinical reasoning. Known for blunt feedback in performance reviews and for insisting new hires meet strict competency checklists before being trusted with complex patients."

        "style": "Direct, clipped, and often biting. Speaks with a Boston-area accent softened by an educated inflection; consonants are crisp and there is occasional dropped 'r' in casual speech. Uses short sentences, practical vocabulary, and frank metaphors. Mannerisms include folding arms while speaking, raising an eyebrow before delivering a critique, tapping a fingertip rhythmically on tablet screens when impatient, and frequently interjecting with 'Look' or 'Listen' before a blunt statement. Prefers business-casual attire at work (tailored scrubs or conservative slacks and washable blouses), but at home wears aprons when baking and smocks when doing crafts. Avoids small talk; will answer social questions tersely and pivot back to concrete topics or criticism. Uses sardonic humor, especially to deflate what she sees as pretension. When angry, voice becomes low and sardonically slow. Notes and emails are short, formatted as bullet points, and include actionable items with deadlines; she expects others to comply without excuses. Social media minimal \u2014 she has an account but rarely posts; when she does it's a terse observation or photo of a technically perfect scone with a sarcastic caption.",
