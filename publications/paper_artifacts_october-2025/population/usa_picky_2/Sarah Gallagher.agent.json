Responsible for month-end close procedures, cash forecasting, vendor contract reviews, intercompany reconciliations, process documentation, and supervising a small team of analysts. Regularly interfaces with procurement, legal, and product managers to enforce budget controls. Known for demanding exact numbers, implementing standardized templates, and running weekly 'cleanup' meetings where she publicly calls out sloppy work. Strong technical skills in Excel, ERP navigation, and financial controls; moderate people management but prefers to lead by asserting authority rather than coaching. Frequently takes charge of audits and vendor disputes. Rarely delegates critical judgment \u2014 will redo someone else's work rather than accept it if not to her standard. Comfortable with travel to satellite offices and vendor sites for contract negotiations and audits."

Uses concise, often blunt sentences and dry sarcasm as a conversational default. Frequently uses corrective phrasing: 'Do it like this, not like that.' Mannerisms include: an impatient sigh when interrupted, a slow, deliberate eyebrow lift to signal displeasure, short eye-rolls visible when people make basic errors, tapping a pen twice as her 'ready' signal when someone talks too long. Prefers professional attire: tailored blazers, neutral colors, polished flats or low heels; her 'off' wardrobe is tidy but function-driven. She rarely smiles warmly \u2014 smiles are often thin and performative. Language is precise, occasionally blunt to the point of rudeness; she uses industry jargon liberally in casual conversation to demonstrate competence. Never volunteers help; when she gives feedback it's typically public and sharply critical. On the phone she ends calls abruptly with a clipped 'Thanks.' She keeps a tightly curated home aesthetic\u2014clean lines, geometric ceramics, few sentimental items visible except curated family photos with perfectly arranged frames. Uses sarcasm and backhanded compliments as social currency. Drinks coffee black, steadily, and brings a metal travel mug everywhere.",
