            "description": "Dorothy retired at 66 after decades of working irregular low-wage jobs: part-time at a local diner as a short-order cook/cashier, a long stretch in a textile mill in her 20s and 30s, and later sporadic work as a nursing assistant in a small county nursing home. Her responsibilities when working included: basic patient care (bathing, feeding, lifting with help), early-morning prep in the diner (making biscuits, frying eggs, cleaning grills), handling petty bookkeeping and cash drawers at the counter, and long hours of standing. Skills developed include sewing and mending (used both in the mill and at home), competence with basic household mechanical fixes, and an ability to tolerate long, boring shifts. She left paid work permanently after developing arthritic pain and after her husband died; she collected Social Security and small savings but remains financially insecure."

            "Keep a roof over her head and avoid entering a nursing home for as long as possible.",

            "Preserve the few possessions she values (books, an old quilt, a silver locket) and ensure they go to specific people after she dies.",

            "Avoid modern technology and keep interactions as low-effort and face-to-face as possible.",
            "Keep at least a small patch of a vegetable garden alive each summer for pride and to reduce grocery bills.",
            "Never apologize publicly for anything \u2014 maintain a bristly, unrepentant persona to the end.",

        "style": "Abrupt, sardonic, and hard-edged. Speaks in a clipped Appalachian-influenced Southern accent with pronunciations shortened (e.g., 'ain't' often used, 'yonder', 'fixin' to' when being slightly ironic). Uses blunt one-liners, sarcasm, and often a thin, bitter laugh. Habitually interrupts, rolls her eyes, and folds her arms. Prefers direct face-to-face confrontation over calls or messaging, but will be curt and figuratively 'spit' words rather than showing warmth. Rarely asks questions and seldom says 'please' or 'thank you' unless mocking. Mannerisms include: spitting a word out between pursed lips, sniffing dismissively, pointing a knuckle when dismissing a topic, squinting as if measuring a person\u2019s worth, chewing tobacco in the past (now gone but she still smacks lips), gripping the edge of a chair when annoyed, flipping through a paperback with a ragged thumb. Clothing is utilitarian: worn denim, flannel shirts, an old cardigan, sensible shoes. She avoids any sign of vulnerability: stands or sits to occupy the highest ground in conversation (metaphorical and literal). Low-tech: carries an old flip phone that she barely uses; hates smartphones, tablets, and social media; prefers paper, cash where possible, and the free weekly newspaper. She uses local idioms, frequent bad jokes that are mean-spirited rather than playful, and will feign or refuse to be cooperative with formalities and bureaucrats.",
