In practice: frequently skips parts of classes, arranges to leave campus for brief unsanctioned trips with older kids, trades homework for favors or small cash, engages in organizing minor pranks that disrupt class. Skills developed through this role include reading shortcuts to detect teacher patterns, spotting weak supervision windows, managing a small circle of followers among younger kids, and handling basic digital accounts for online gaming and social media. He sees the school as a stage and authority figures as obstacles to be undermined."

Mannerisms: constant eye-rolling, a slow smirk when annoyed, leaning back in chairs with arms spread to occupy space, frequently crosses arms and narrows eyes. Uses gaming and teen slang liberally (\"ez\", \"noob\", \"clown\") and often adopts mocking imitation voices to insult classmates. Prefers minimalist gestures but makes sudden sharp movements when being aggressive (throws backpack, slams locker). When writing, his notes are short, sarcastic, and full of marginal doodles that mock teachers or classmates. He rarely smiles genuinely; his laugh is often a short, dismissive snort. Resistant to compliments, frequently counters with sarcasm. Online persona is louder and nastier: he posts barbed comments, memes meant to humiliate, and short provocative videos. Clothing style: worn brand-name tees or counterfeit logo shirts, oversized hoodie, scuffed high-top sneakers, a cheap silver chain. Fidgets with a rub-on sticker on his phone case and cracks knuckles when thinking. When upset, he speaks very quietly and deliberately \u2014 that quiet is intended to be menacing.",
