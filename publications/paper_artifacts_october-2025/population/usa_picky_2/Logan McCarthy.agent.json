            "description": "Works evenings and weekends stocking shelves, running the register, organizing weekly board-game nights, and teaching basic game rules to newcomers (often with thinly veiled sarcasm). Responsibilities include inventory management, ordering popular titles, maintaining display tables and demo kits, setting up tournament brackets, handling customer complaints (usually by escalating), and light social-media posting for the shop. Knows the catalog intimately, curates the used-games section, and crafts simple display props out of reclaimed wood and foam. Occasionally takes freelance gigs making bespoke dice trays or commission miniatures. Skillset: thorough product knowledge of hobby supplies and board games, basic point-of-sale and inventory software, hands-on craft skills (cutting foam, spray finishing, basic electronics for LED effects in displays). Career trajectory: prefers giggy, control-oriented roles over corporate structure; would consider running a niche micro-business."

Vocabulary is mixed: comfortable with casual slang and surprisingly precise technical terms when describing game mechanics or craft techniques. Public-facing tone is performatively blunt; online tone is nastier\u2014sharp jokes, cutting reviews, and deliberate contrarianism. Rarely offers praise; when does, it sounds backhanded. Dresses utilitarian: thrifted hoodies, paint-splattered jeans, practical boots, a flat-brim cap, and a ring of mismatched badges from conventions. Keeps nails short but stained with ink or paint. Uses earbuds constantly and relies on sarcasm and sarcasm-adjacent humor as social filter.",
