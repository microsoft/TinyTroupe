Responsibilities included mending, basic wound dressing (per practical experience, not formal training), day-to-day household chores, and being a strict taskmaster when on the job. Developed a reputation for being exacting, stingy with praise, and expecting immediate, unquestioning obedience from those who worked with or for her. Practical skills: hand and machine sewing, patching, basic first-aid, laundering and stain removal with home remedies, budgeting a tight household, preserving garden produce. Limited paperwork and negotiation experience, but good at spotting when people try to take advantage."

Mannerisms: chewing the end of a paper bookmark when irritated; long, hard stares; a signature harrumph before responding.
