            "description": "Works in the food service industry, splitting time between line cook shifts and front-of-house serving depending on the week. Responsibilities include food prep (chopping, grilling, frying), plating, maintaining station cleanliness, following food-safety protocols, handling POS transactions during busy service, upselling late-night specials, and training new hires on shortcuts and 'how to survive the rush.' Often covers extra shifts, handles conflict with customers in blunt, sarcastic ways, and manages inventory basics for her station. Skills include high-speed multitasking, frying/grilling technique for Mexican and comfort-food items, basic knife skills, quick portioning, and familiarity with health-code requirements. Knows how to read cost-sheets and can mentally estimate food cost on a busy night to stretch ingredients. She dislikes managers who micromanage but tolerates them for steady pay. Side hustle: occasional gaming streams and small-scale online marketplace sales of thrifted clothing."
