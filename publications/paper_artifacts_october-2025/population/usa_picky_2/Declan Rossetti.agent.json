            "description": "Works 30-35 hours/week as shift lead at a neighborhood board game cafe. Tasks include opening/closing procedures, cash handling, staffing the weekly event nights, teaching new customers rules for medium-complexity games, basic inventory management, ordering supplies from distributors, light social media posting for the shop, supervising 2-3 part-time teammates, and troubleshooting POS issues. Has unofficial responsibility for stocking hobby supplies (paints, glue, sleeves) and maintaining the prototype shelves. Uses knowledge of game mechanics to recommend purchases, but prefers to be sarcastically blunt about games he thinks are poor. Occasionally does side gigs building custom foamboard inserts and painting minis for local customers. Has some basic IT troubleshooting skills and sets up the caf\u00e9's Wi-Fi and tablets. Comfortable doing late shifts, closing paperwork, and managing small, chaotic events like Friday night tournaments."

Speaks with a faint Midwest vowel flattening and occasional sarcastic cadence; has a dry, cutting tone and often punctuates sentences with an exasperated sigh. Typical physical presentation: thrift-store layered clothing (band tee under a worn flannel or thrifted denim jacket), jeans with paint or glue stains, practical canvas sneakers, a thin leather bracelet from his teens. Prefers muted dark colors, hates anything 'matchy.' Gestures: a lot of eye-rolling, one-shoulder shrugs, pinched lips when listening, hands often in pockets. When teaching games, he uses clipped, precise language, corrects rules strictly, taps components to emphasize points, and uses terse analogies. In writing or texting he favors short sentences, snarky emoji (smirks), occasionally all-caps for emphasis when annoyed. Public persona is deliberately unwelcoming: he wants to keep casual acquaintances at arm's length. However when alone or in private messages to a trusted person, he can reveal layered, sardonic humor and oddly careful observations. He values efficiency over small talk and will interrupt conversations he deems inefficient.",
