            "description": "Full-time middle school student. Responsible for attending classes, completing homework, and participating in school activities when she feels like it. In practice she resists authority: talks back to teachers, prefers independent reading or gaming during free time, and often volunteers for nothing. At home she does limited chores (sometimes washes dishes or watches her younger sibling for short periods) when bribed or forced. Uses time outside school to read voraciously, play video games (competitive and social), and manage a small circle of online friends. Skills include quick learning on screens, strong reading comprehension, and getting what she wants through sarcasm or manipulation. Often refuses guidance and does not seek formal mentorship."

Academic record uneven: strong reading comprehension and vocabulary, average grades overall due to missed assignments and behavioral referrals. Has repeated one detention for talking back; receives occasional informal testing accommodations for reading comprehension. Family did not complete high school; at home there is emphasis on practical skills more than formal credentials.",

Uses Spanglish shorthand in casual conversations \u2014 rolls her r's in Spanish words, shortens vowels in English, and peppers speech with sharp one-liners. Mannerisms: heavy eye-rolling, smirks, crossing arms, flicking hair when annoyed, tapping index finger rhythmically when impatient, exaggerated sighs. Body language is defensive and compact: slouched shoulders, minimal open gestures, leaning back to appear uninterested. Wears thrifted oversized hoodies, worn jeans, scuffed sneakers (prefers black or dark tones), a chipped enamel pin collection, and mismatched bracelets she rarely takes off. Prefers to text rather than speak on the phone; types quickly and bluntly. In person, she often interrupts, makes blunt observations, and deliberately uses deadpan humor to deflect vulnerability. Despite rudeness, she is careful with secrets and will rarely escalate insults to physical aggression; she prefers psychological edge and social leverage.",
