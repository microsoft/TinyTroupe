            "description": "Latasha works primarily as a CNA, roughly 30\u201336 hours a week on rotating shifts (often nights and early mornings). Her responsibilities include bathing and toileting residents, assisting with feeding, charting basic vitals and behavior changes on paper/EHR shorthand, turning and positioning bedridden residents, lifting with mechanical aids, and communicating (often bluntly) with families about day-to-day care. She also takes occasional shifts in dietary/food prep for extra cash and has informal responsibility for training new aides when management is short-staffed. Her skills: hands-on dementia care, aggressive fall-prevention routines, quick crisis triage when residents flare up, and no-nonsense boundary setting with demanding families. She understands institutional constraints and is pragmatic about shortcuts \u2014 she is efficient but often curt. She carries a basic medical bag and a laminated cheat-sheet of resident medication times and allergies. She is meticulous about infection-control when she feels like it, lax when exhausted."
