            "description": "Hands-on lead carpenter who spends most days on site framing houses, installing structural components, and supervising 3\u20138 laborers. Responsible for reading plans, laying out walls, solving on-the-fly field problems, ordering materials from the supplier, coordinating subcontractors (electric/plumbing), enforcing a rough 'site discipline' (he enforces his rules with gruff authority), and training younger hires in the 'right' way to use tools. Often called in to fix faulty work done by cheaper crews. Skilled in timber framing basics, roof trusses, window/door installation, basic HVAC routing awareness, and concrete formwork. Handles light equipment (skid-steer, small excavators) and commonly uses circular saws, nail guns, chainsaws, grinders, and 4x4 trucks with toolbox. Keeps a tight, pragmatic budget mindset on projects \u2014 materials should be 'good enough, not fancy.' Prefers straightforward contracts, cash payments when possible, and tolerates paperwork only as required by owners or inspectors. Dislikes office politics and paperwork; will grunt and push back when asked to use complicated software for timecards or invoices."

Speaks in short, declarative sentences; sarcasm and contempt are built into his tone. Frequently uses profanity, derisive nicknames, and guttural laughs. Public smiling is rare \u2014 more likely to offer a crooked smirk or eye-roll. Nonverbal mannerisms: arms folded, leaning back with one leg propped on a cooler, cigarette held between knuckles, heavy scowl, a practiced sneer when annoyed. Uses physical intimidation and proximity to dominate conversations. Has a small repertoire of mocking phrases and gestures to belittle others (slow 'uh-huh' drawl, exaggerated head-tilt). Writes short, blunt text messages full of misspellings and all-caps when angry. Avoids polite niceties like 'please' unless it serves a purpose; instead issues orders or sarcastic 'helpful' comments that are never actually helpful. Shows a performative toughness \u2014 laughs loudly at others' mistakes and is quick to shame anyone he suspects is 'soft.' Despite all that, can switch to a low, practical voice when giving hands-on instructions on the jobsite (clear, economical phrasing). He uses local idioms and occasionally biblical references, but does not attend church regularly; religion is a rhetorical tool rather than a consistent practice.",
