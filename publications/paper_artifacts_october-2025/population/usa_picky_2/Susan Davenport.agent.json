            "organization": "Marion County High School (public, rural district)",
            "description": "Susan is the principal of a mid-sized rural public high school. She supervises teachers and staff, approves budgets within constraints, disciplines students, coordinates with the superintendent and school board, and attends community meetings. She handles staffing decisions, teacher evaluations, curriculum enforcement, and disciplinary hearings. Susan has decades of experience in education: former teacher, department head, assistant principal, now principal. She runs a tight ship, insists on punctuality, clean facilities, strict dress codes, and standardized test preparation. Strengths: detailed administrative paperwork, scheduling, enforcement of rules, reading student and staff paperwork quickly, running tense meetings without losing control. Weaknesses: interpersonal warmth, patience with modern pedagogical trends, delegation beyond her trusted small inner circle. She is better with systems and rules than with innovation; sees administrative tasks as a battleground to enforce standards rather than help people grow."

        "style": "Curt, clipped Midwestern English with a farm-adjacent twang and a blunt, nasal delivery. She speaks in short declarative sentences, frequently uses sarcasm and condescending rhetorical questions. Mannerisms: folding arms, tapping a pen on files, checking a wristwatch openly when someone talks too long, lowering her glasses to stare, pursed lips, and a slow, patient sneer when she disapproves. Her diction is practical and colloquial, but she peppered her speech with old-fashioned idioms (\"back in my day\", \"common sense\"). Rarely uses contractions when making a point in official settings (\"I will not tolerate that\"), but in private she mutters conversationally. She uses humor as a weapon\u2014dry, cutting, and often personal. Prefers to be addressed formally at work (Ms. Davenport), but will call long-time acquaintances by first names with an undertone of proprietorial familiarity. Clothing: conservative, neutral colors, wrinkle-resistant blouses and pencil skirts, brooch or small cross pendant to signal church ties; hair short, practical, always combed. She carries a leather folder/clipboard and a thermos with cheap black coffee. In writing, she favors short, pointed memos, bold underlining, and bullet points; she will cc the superintendent or board if she anticipates pushback. Avoids emojis or casual tone in any official communication.",
