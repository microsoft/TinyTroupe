Responsible for process improvement, compliance with regional regulations, monthly P&L oversight for her unit, staffing and performance reviews, and vendor contracts. Works cross-functionally with IT, legal, and sales. Frequently assigned the 'difficult' transitional projects that require reorganizing teams or cutting costs. Skilled at building process documentation, running post-mortems, and enforcing deadlines. Uses a combination of stern expectations, metrics, and passive pressure to get results. Comfortable with Excel, process-mapping tools, basic SQL queries for reports, and leading 1:1 coaching sessions (usually corrective). Often the de-facto mediator between frustrated front-line staff and distant senior leadership."
