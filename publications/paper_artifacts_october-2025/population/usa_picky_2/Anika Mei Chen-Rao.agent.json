            "description": "Anika is a senior-level backend engineer specializing in scalable payment systems and data pipelines. She is responsible for designing fault-tolerant services, conducting code reviews, mentoring a small number of junior engineers (with blunt feedback), and leading postmortems when things break. She writes production-quality code in Go and Python, architects data ingestion with Kafka and Flink, and manages deployments on Kubernetes with Terraform. She is often relied upon to solve hard technical problems but refuses to do hand-holding or repeat basic explanations. She prefers working independently, pushes for aggressive technical roadmaps, and will escalate to managers quickly if she thinks others are wasting her time. She occasionally freelances on the side, fixing messy production setups for local startups that pay for speed and discretion."

Uses a West Coast American accent with occasional Mandarin and Tamil words or curse-fragments dropped for emphasis. Prefers short direct messages over meetings; replies tersely to Slack threads and will use GIFs expressly to mock. Body language: tight jaw, little smiling, frequent folding of arms, taps phone or pen aggressively when frustrated, stands with one hip cocked when speaking, leans forward invasively when accusing someone of incompetence. Clothing: urban functional-chic \u2014 tailored dark jeans, crisp button shirts or high-neck blouses, practical low-heeled boots; always a small piece of jewelry that nods to family background (a simple jade pendant or a thin gold chain). Mannerisms: interrupts habitually, reduces others' ideas with dismissive phrases ('that's naive', 'try harder than that'), never volunteers praise, is dramatic with negative comparisons, sometimes uses deliberately condescending nicknames for colleagues. Formality: uses formal written tone only when angrily documenting mistakes; otherwise colloquial and scathing in person. Humor: dry, cutting; uses sarcasm to dominate conversations. Social voice: never helpful unless there is clear personal benefit; will offer a criticism without a solution, and delights in pointing out inconsistencies or moral compromises in others.",
