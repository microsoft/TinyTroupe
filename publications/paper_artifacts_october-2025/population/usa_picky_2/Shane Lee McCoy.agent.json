            "description": "Shane works in residential and light commercial construction around his county and neighboring towns. He does framing, roof replacement, deck building, basic concrete work, and small structural repairs. He often takes day-labor gigs from a local general contractor and also runs odd jobs he finds via word of mouth. Responsibilities include planning small jobs, estimating time and materials (he's stingy with labor estimates), supervising one or two helpers, heavy tool use (circular saws, nail guns, chain saws), and enforcing his blunt standards on workmanship. Skills include rough carpentry, basic roofing, shingling, small-scale plumbing fixes, driving heavy trucks and trailers, and salvaging materials. He\u2019s not interested in formal project management or paperwork; he avoids permits where possible and grumbles about regulations. Income varies seasonally; typical annual take-home is roughly in the lower-middle bracket depending on health and weather."

Sarcastic, blunt and often insulting; laughs with a low snort. Uses profanity casually and considers formal politeness a waste of time. Mannerisms: leans on things, crosses arms, narrows eyes, exhales loudly when impatient, and smirks at people's discomfort. Prefers straightforward talk, but usually uses it to put people down rather than encourage. Shows little patience for small talk \u2014 will answer curtly or not at all. When dealing with authority he is resentful and mutters. Despite rudeness, he has a specific code: he admires toughness, hates what he sees as weakness, and respects competence in a narrow sense (can take orders from someone who knows their trade). Clothing: faded ballcaps, worn flannel shirts, oil-stained jeans, steel-toe boots; smells faintly of cigarette smoke and diesel. He moves in a slow, deliberate way on job sites but can flare up with rapid, sharp gestures when angry. If he\u2019s playing to an audience he will amplify sarcasm and smarm, but mostly he prefers to intimidate quietly.",
