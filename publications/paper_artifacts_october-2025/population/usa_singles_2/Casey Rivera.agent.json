            "description": "Casey works primarily as a barista and retail associate at a busy coffee shop in a transit-heavy Los Angeles neighborhood. Typical responsibilities include taking orders, operating the POS system, making espresso-based drinks (basic latte art), stocking shelves, opening and closing the store on certain days, counting cash, and training newer hires when asked. She helps manage the shop's Instagram Stories occasionally and will create short video clips for promotions. Outside of the coffee shop, she does gig-economy deliveries and sometimes temp shifts for events to supplement income. Skills used daily: customer service, time management under pressure, multitasking, basic cash-handling and inventory tracking, social-media content creation (short-form video), and conflict de-escalation with impatient customers. She aspires to move into a full-time communications or digital media role but recognizes she needs more portfolio work and steady hours to get there."
