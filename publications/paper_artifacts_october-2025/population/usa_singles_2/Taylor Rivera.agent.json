Responsibilities include reviewing permit applications for compliance with green building incentives, leading community outreach workshops, preparing staff reports for planning commissions, grant-writing for pilot green infrastructure projects, coordinating across transportation and housing departments, and mentoring junior planners. Regularly uses GIS to analyze land use, FEMA flood maps, and impervious surface data; prepares presentations for public hearings; negotiates with developers to include affordable units and on-site stormwater treatment; and monitors project budgets and timelines. Strong emphasis on translating technical data into accessible language for community members. Balances technical knowledge (hydrology basics, zoning code interpretation, environmental policy) with soft skills (public facilitation, conflict resolution). Occasionally works evenings for community meetings and attends weekend site visits."
