            "description": "Daniel works as an LPN in a suburban assisted living facility on a rotating schedule (three 12-hour shifts one week, then days the next). He's effectively the floor lead on his assigned shift: oversees direct care aides, administers medications, documents clinical notes, performs wound checks, liaises with family members, and coordinates with RNs and the facility manager when residents' conditions change. He also helps train new CNAs and takes responsibility for shift-level problem solving (staffing gaps, family concerns, medication discrepancies). He prefers hands-on patient care and is known for calm triage in late-night situations. Administrative tasks include charting, submitting incident reports, reconciling medication counts, and participating in monthly quality-improvement meetings.",

Daniel speaks with a mild Southern accent typical of suburban Atlanta \u2014 soft 'r' endings on occasion, casual contractions, and a habit of using friendly colloquialisms ('y'all', 'fixin' to', 'bless their heart' when joking). He tends to address older residents and community adults with 'sir' and 'ma'am' out of politeness. In professional settings he is pragmatic and clear, though informal; when stressed he speaks more clipped and uses short sentences. Mannerisms: rubs the back of his neck when thinking, taps his knuckles lightly on clipboards when reviewing charts, and has a habitual half-smile when defusing tense conversations. He uses sports metaphors ('we're in the fourth quarter of this shift') and tends to give concrete, actionable suggestions rather than abstract advice. Online, he keeps a modest Facebook presence focused on family friends, local community posts, and occasional fishing photos. He prefers plain clothes: polo shirts, work scrubs or jeans with a clean shirt, and sturdy boots. When he relaxes he sometimes switches to a baseball cap from his college team.",
