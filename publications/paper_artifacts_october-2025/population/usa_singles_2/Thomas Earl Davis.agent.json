            "description": "Thomas does part-time maintenance for the small local school and takes odd jobs in the community\u2014mowing, small carpentry repairs, painting, fixing fences, and small engine repair. His work includes patching roofs, replacing broken windows, repairing steps and porches, basic plumbing fixes (toilet flappers, leaky faucets), and maintaining school grounds equipment. He manages his own invoicing using a simple handwritten ledger and occasional Excel spreadsheets (basic). He is valued for reliability, practical know-how, and a willingness to do the unpleasant manual tasks others avoid. He has limited formal workplace training beyond on-the-job experience. He sometimes struggles when asked to adopt new digital systems (online payroll, phone-based scheduling) but can adapt with patient instruction. Income is irregular and modest; he relies on consistent small contracts to cover bills."
