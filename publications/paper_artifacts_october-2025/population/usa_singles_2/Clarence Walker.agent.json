            "description": "Clarence spent roughly 40 years working as a maintenance mechanic at a small manufacturing plant near his town. His daily responsibilities included diagnosing and repairing conveyor belts, electric motors, hydraulic systems, and occasional welding. He was the go-to person for late-night breakdowns on weekend production runs. He trained a couple of younger technicians informally, kept meticulous notes on recurring problems, and handled ordering replacement parts later in his career. He retired (displaced/early retirement) about 8 years ago when the plant reduced operations. Since retiring he does freelance handyman work for a few longtime neighbors, fixes small engines (lawnmowers, tractors), and helps out at community events with setup/tear-down. His technical strengths are mechanical troubleshooting, basic electrical repair, welding (stick and MIG), small engine repair, and using hand and bench tools. He has modest digital skills\u2014can use a smartphone for calls, text, and weather, and will look up YouTube videos when solving a tricky repair problem."
