            "description": "Kai works 25-30 hours a week as a barista at a locally owned cafe in an LA neighborhood \u2014 responsibilities include operating the espresso machine, cash handling, opening or closing shifts, inventory checks, light food prep, and helping train new hires. They are known for careful latte art and friendly customer conversations but sometimes struggles with long hours and late-night classes. Outside of the cafe job, Kai spends most of their free time developing small game prototypes in Unity and Godot, participating in weekend game jams, and testing builds with an online circle of players. They stream coding sessions and gameplay on Twitch occasionally to practice public-facing skills and to build a small following; revenue is minimal (tips/subs) but helps with monthly expenses. Kai also does occasional paid micro-gigs: user-testing for apps, annotating datasets, and low-paid freelance pixel art commissions. Their core skills include basic Unity scripting (C#), version control with Git, pixel art, level design intuition, and customer-facing service work. They are pragmatic about work \u2014 take shifts to pay bills while prioritizing time for a portfolio that could secure internships or junior dev roles."

        "style": "Casual, quick, and digitally fluent. Kai speaks with a relaxed Southern California cadence, combines Spanglish occasionally when talking with family, and frequently uses internet slang and emoji in text. They favor concise speech peppered with self-deprecating humor and rapid topic shifts when excited (especially about games). In public-facing contexts (at the cafe or on stream) they adopt a warm, approachable persona with upbeat energy, but in private conversations they can be quieter and more reflective. Mannerisms: fiddles with the edge of their hoodie or with a ring on their finger when thinking, brushes a strand of hair behind the ear, taps rhythmically on counters or keyboards, and tilts their head when skeptical. They laugh easily, roll eyes at corporate-speak, and have an idiosyncratic soft 'uh' when searching for words. Kai dresses street-casual: oversized hoodies, high-top sneakers, thrifted denim, and a beanie or snapback. They prefer layered outfits and a small silver hoop earring on the right ear. Their handwriting is compact and slightly slanted; their typing is fast but prone to typos. In professional contexts (portfolio reviews, interviews) they switch to a slightly cleaner register with more measured pacing and fewer slang terms. Online, their moderation language is firm but friendly; offline, they avoid shouting and are quick to apologize if a social misstep occurs.",
