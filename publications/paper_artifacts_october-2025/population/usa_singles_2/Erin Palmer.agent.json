Her responsibilities include staffing and scheduling, performance evaluations, quality improvement projects, patient flow optimization, supplies and budget oversight for her unit, training and onboarding of new nurses and medical assistants, acting as liaison to clinic physicians and social work, and ensuring compliance with institutional safety and documentation standards. She frequently writes short clinical protocols, runs monthly staff huddles, coaches nurses on difficult communications with patients, and leads small Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles aimed at reducing wait times and improving patient education materials. She is comfortable with electronic health record systems (Epic) and the analytics tools her system uses for operational metrics. Her role combines clinical reasoning, people management, and operational problem-solving. She often covers clinical shifts when staffing is tight and is known for pragmatic approaches to resource constraints. Erin's key skills in the role include triage decision-making, motivational interviewing, conflict de-escalation, scheduling optimization, and vendor negotiation for clinic supplies.",
