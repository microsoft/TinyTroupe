            "description": "Raymond retired from full-time factory maintenance work after the plant reduced hours and before a scheduled layoff; he collects a modest Social Security benefit and sometimes earns cash doing carpentry, small engine repair (lawnmowers, chainsaws), trailer hitch installations, and plumbing patches for neighbors. He mows local yards in summer for pocket money and will haul debris with his old pickup. Skills: mechanical troubleshooting, residential carpentry repairs, basic electrical fixes, small engine tune-ups, sheet metal familiarity, welding basics, roof shingle patching. Responsibilities when he worked: preventive maintenance on assembly line equipment, troubleshooting electrical/motor failures, documenting repairs the supervisor required. Current constraints: limited mobility from knee arthritis, cannot lift very heavy loads often, transportation dependent on his 2007 F-150. Income irregular and low; reports cash and check payments from neighbors and some small contracts with the town public works during busy seasons."
