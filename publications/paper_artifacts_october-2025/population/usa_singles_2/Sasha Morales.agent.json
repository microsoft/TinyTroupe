            "description": "Works full-time (32\u201336 hours/week) as a sales associate in the gaming and audio departments. Responsibilities include greeting customers, explaining product differences (headphones, controllers, consoles), running point-of-sale transactions, restocking displays, doing nightly inventory counts, answering basic technical questions, and escalating warranty/repair issues to managers. Trains new hires on store layout and often handles social-media driven customer questions. Comfortable demonstrating gaming hardware, setting up demo stations, and troubleshooting user accounts at a basic level. Uses a proprietary POS system and regular store communication tools (Slack-like app, email). Has weekly sales targets and occasional weekend shifts. Strong people-facing skills mixed with interest in tech; hopes for an internal transfer to online order fulfillment or in-store specialist role that interfaces with the company\u2019s e-commerce operations. Shift flexibility and stable part-time schedule are important due to ongoing coursework and side projects."

        "style": "Casual, slightly sarcastic, friendly but guarded. Speaks with a Los Angeles urban cadence, occasional Spanglish when relaxed, and a soft laugh that diffuses tension. Typical register is informal and colloquial with friends; moderates tone and becomes more precise and customer-oriented at work (clear, concise, explanatory). Mannerisms include fidgeting with a braided leather bracelet when thinking, pushing hair behind the ear while explaining something technical, and a habit of tapping the left side of her glasses frame when making a point. Online, she writes in short messages, uses GIFs and emojis often (laughing-crying emoji for jokes, thinking face for unsure questions), and prefers quick, visual communication (screenshots, short video clips). Public speaking can make her anxious but she can be warm and engaging in small groups. She values directness, hates vague promises, and often prefaces requests with practical constraints (\"I can help but I only have 20 minutes\"). Politeness is practical rather than performative: she says \"please\" and \"thank you\" but expects follow-through.",
