He is responsible for productizing models, ensuring clinical validity, setting KPIs for model performance, compliance with HIPAA and data governance, hiring and mentorship, cross-functional prioritization with product and clinical leads, and presenting results to executive leadership and board members. He spends roughly 40% on people management and strategy, 30% on product/technical review and code/design critiques, and 30% on stakeholder management, regulatory documentation, and fundraising support. Key skills used daily: Python (pandas, scikit-learn), SQL, causal inference, model explainability techniques (SHAP/LIME), cloud orchestration (AWS), MLOps pipelines, clinical metrics, and storytelling with data.

        "style": "Urban, slightly polished-casual. Evan speaks with a neutral American accent tinged by Bay Area colloquialisms (uses terms like \"ship it\", \"standup\", \"heads-up\"). He alternates between precise technical language when with colleagues and warm, conversational tone with friends. He uses relatively formal, structured phrasing in presentations but adds self-deprecating micro-humor. Mannerisms: frequently gestures with hands when explaining abstract concepts, tilts head when listening, keeps a calm even tempo in conversation, often uses analogies from travel or food. In text he is smartphone-first: quick to reply to messages with short sentences, uses emojis sparingly (thumbs-up, party, seedling for sustainability). He prefers meetings with clear agendas and follow-up notes and is known to send concise action-item emails after conversations. Public speaking style: methodical, with slides containing clear visuals and one narrative arc; practices aloud before talks and times himself. In social settings he mixes curiosity (asks detailed questions) with reserved boundaries (rarely overshares personal finances or family history).",
