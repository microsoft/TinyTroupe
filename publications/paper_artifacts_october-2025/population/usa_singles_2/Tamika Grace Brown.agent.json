She also helps with morning medication observations and documents basic care tasks. Responsibilities include communicating with families during visiting hours, coordinating with social services for discharge or community services, and mentoring newer CNAs occasionally. She prioritizes resident dignity and culturally familiar meals and music. Skills used daily include patient lifting and transfer techniques, fall prevention, infection control, basic wound observation (reporting to RN), and emergency response procedures. She sometimes picks up extra shifts at a neighborhood community clinic during flu season as a medical aide doing screenings and intake paperwork. Main work stressors are unpredictable staffing, low pay relative to workload, and witnessing residents' decline. She manages these by leaning on a close team of coworkers and her church support group."
