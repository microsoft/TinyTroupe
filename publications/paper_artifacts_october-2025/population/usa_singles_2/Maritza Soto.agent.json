She arrives before the restaurant opens to prep beans, rice, sauces, and pastries; manages inventory of perishables for the week; cleans and sanitizes prep areas; and occasionally takes short daytime shifts on the line when staff are short. Responsibilities include measuring ingredients, following family-style recipes, monitoring oven temps, labeling foods for rotation, portioning to control costs, and communicating shortages to the manager. She is relied upon for consistent morning production and has become the informal trainer for newer prep staff. Her job requires good stamina, food-safety awareness, speed, and the ability to work in a hot kitchen. She has rudimentary math for scaling recipes and an intuitive sense for taste and seasoning developed from years cooking for family events.",

Uses colloquial English with neighbors and coworkers and shifts to more careful, polite phrasing when dealing with managers or official forms. Prefers straightforward, honest communication and small, practical gestures (bringing someone a leftover pastry, sharing phone minutes). Mannerisms include wiping hands on apron when thinking, tucking hair behind her ear when concentrating, and using expressive hand gestures while telling a story. She laughs easily but is quick to get serious around money or health topics. In text messages she favors short sentences, emojis sometimes, and occasional Spanish words for emphasis. Clothing style is functional and durable: simple cotton dresses or jeans with a smock at work, comfortable sneakers, a small gold hoop earring she rarely takes off. Social media presence is modest\u2014mostly Facebook to keep in touch with family and a private Instagram where she posts photos of dishes and occasional street scenes. Tends to be punctual for shifts but sometimes asks for shift swaps to attend family medical appointments. She values cleanliness and order in the kitchen but tolerates small messes at home when tired.",
