            "description": "Jamie is employed full-time as a foreman and experienced carpenter for a small regional contractor that builds and renovates single-family homes and light commercial buildings. His responsibilities include: planning daily job tasks; supervising a crew of 3\u20136 laborers and apprentices; reading blueprints and coordinating with subcontractors (electricians, plumbers, HVAC); measuring and ordering materials; ensuring job site safety and OSHA compliance; performing skilled carpentry tasks (framing, decking, trim work); troubleshooting on-site problems; and speaking with clients about finish details and schedules. He also does occasional estimating for medium-sized remodels. Relevant skills: framing, finish carpentry, basic blueprint reading, material estimating, crew leadership, jobsite safety, small equipment operation (skid-steer, nail guns, chop saw). Primary stresses are schedule delays, weather, and coordinating subcontractors. He prefers steady, predictable projects over risky, one-off gigs."
