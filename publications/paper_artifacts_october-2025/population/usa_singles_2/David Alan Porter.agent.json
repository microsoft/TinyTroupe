            "description": "David works as a lead carpenter and small crew supervisor focusing on single-family home renovations, additions, and new residential framing. He is responsible for: estimating labor hours for jobs; supervising a crew of 2\u20134 carpenters and helpers; ensuring on-site safety and OSHA compliance; coordinating with homeowners and general contractors on change orders; performing finish carpentry (doors, trim, cabinets) and rough framing; reading blueprints and translating them into actionable day plans; ordering materials and managing small budgets for his crew; training apprentices on best practices and safety. He commonly performs hands-on work (80% of his time) and administrative tasks (20%). He has 18 years of trade experience and a practical, problem-solving approach\u2014good at improvising when a plan fails because houses are rarely perfect squares. He does occasional weekend side jobs (decks, fence repair, small remodels) for extra cash and to keep local relationships strong. He prefers steady work over high-risk bidding and does not engage in office politics. He is non-union but knows many union tradespeople and occasionally subcontracts electricians or HVAC people when required."
