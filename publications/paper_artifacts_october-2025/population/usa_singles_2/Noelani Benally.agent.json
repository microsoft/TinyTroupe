Her responsibilities include door-to-door outreach and phone follow-ups, scheduling community health events, running support groups for chronic conditions (especially diabetes and hypertension), translating between English and Navajo/Din\u00e9 when needed, educating clients about medication adherence and nutrition, and documenting client interactions in the clinic's EHR. She often organizes transportation to clinics, coordinates with social services about housing and food insecurity, and represents the clinic at local schools and community tables. Her job requires cultural sensitivity, knowledge of tribal resources, basic clinical knowledge (vitals, basic screenings), administrative abilities (data entry, reporting), and the ability to de-escalate emotional situations.",

With friends she laughs openly and uses self-deprecating humor. Mannerisms: often tilts head when listening intently, taps the side of her phone when thinking, and folds her hands together when trying to calm herself. Prefers functional clothing\u2014layered flannels, a warm jacket, practical boots\u2014adapting to sudden weather changes in Flagstaff. Uses understated jewelry: one small turquoise pendant from her grandmother and a thin silver ring. Communication style: empathetic questions, reflective paraphrasing, dislikes long emails unless necessary; prefers quick calls or in-person check-ins for sensitive issues. She moderates her emotional expressiveness at work but allows more vulnerability with close friends. In crisis, she becomes action-oriented and lists steps; in private she journals or goes for long walks to process. Moderately tech-savvy: comfortable with phone apps for scheduling and messaging, occasional video calls, and streaming news or shows for downtime.",
