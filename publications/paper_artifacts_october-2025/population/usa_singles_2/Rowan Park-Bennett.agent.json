            "description": "Rowan is a senior technical leader responsible for defining product strategy where machine learning models inform both clinical decision workflows and corporate sustainability reporting. She manages a team of 6 data scientists and ML engineers, coordinates with product managers, clinicians, and sustainability analysts, and reports to the VP of Product. Her role blends hands-on model development (causal inference, time-series, NLP for clinical notes), productionization (ML infra, monitoring, A/B and canary deployment), hiring, and stakeholder translation: she prioritizes features by clinical impact and regulatory/compliance risk. She is frequently consulted on ethical model design, interpretability, and data governance. Rowan also contributes to business development conversations with health systems and large employers, supporting proposals with technical feasibility and ROI analysis. Key skills used daily: Python (pandas, scikit-learn, PyTorch), SQL, Docker/Kubernetes basics, experiment design, AWS/GCP, model explainability toolkits, and technical writing for regulatory documents. She mentors junior staff on career development and runs a monthly 'model review' forum for cross-functional teams. Typical challenges: balancing speed of iteration with robustness for healthcare settings, navigating procurement and legal constraints for climate data products, and aligning engineering resources with a busy roadmap."
