            "description": "Taylor works full-time as a project manager in a civil engineering consulting firm that focuses on municipal infrastructure (roads, stormwater systems, small bridges, and pedestrian improvements). He is responsible for client communication, preparing scopes and budgets, coordinating small design teams, overseeing field data collection, reviewing engineers' drawings for constructability, and helping shepherd projects through permitting and municipal review. He spends about 40% of his time in the office managing staff and deliverables, 20% in meetings with city clients, 20% doing technical review and calculations, and the rest visiting sites or coordinating contractors. He is competent with design software (Civil 3D, GIS), understands hydrology and structural basics, and is the go-to person for assigning tasks and keeping schedules on track. He is pragmatic about budgets and timelines, tries to incorporate sustainable, low-impact solutions when feasible, and often mediates between clients who want low cost and contractors who emphasize durability."
