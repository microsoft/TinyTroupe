Responsibilities: prepare high-volume simple Mexican dishes (salsas, shredded meats), manage a small prep station, maintain kitchen sanitation, order basic supplies for the pop-up, and occasionally handle cash. Skills and expertise: bilingual patient communication, CPR/Basic Life Support certified, wound dressing basics, infection control, safe lifting and transfer, basic EHR data entry, kitchen line cooking, food safety (ServSafe basics), time management across split schedules, conflict de-escalation with anxious patients and families. Typical difficulties: balancing long hours, physical fatigue from lifting and standing, occasional frustration with low wages and limited advancement opportunities, scheduling conflicts between clinic needs and weekend food work."
