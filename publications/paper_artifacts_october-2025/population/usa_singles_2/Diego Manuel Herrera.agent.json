            "description": "Diego works full-time as a line cook at a busy taqueria in East Los Angeles and picks up additional weekend catering shifts. His role covers food prep, managing the tortilla station, assembling tacos during peak hours (lunch/dinner rush), keeping inventory lean, receiving deliveries from the market, maintaining food-safety records, and training new kitchen staff. He closes the kitchen a few nights a week and fills out shift reports. He is skilled at knife work, marinating carne asada and al pastor, hand-pressing corn tortillas, and estimating portions to reduce waste. He often communicates directly with front-of-house staff to modify orders for dietary needs and occasionally fills in as short-order cook when the kitchen is understaffed. He is respected for consistency and reliability but wants more managerial responsibility. He has experience negotiating with produce vendors, basic scheduling, and simple cost-per-plate calculations. His typical monthly responsibilities also include small equipment troubleshooting (replacing fryer oil, cleaning griddles) and helping plan specials tied to seasonal Mexican ingredients."
