            "organization": "Regional Planning Department (mid-sized city government)",
            "description": "Jordan works as a planning analyst focusing on sustainability, active transportation, and community engagement. Typical responsibilities include drafting sections of comprehensive plans, performing greenhouse gas emission inventories for municipal operations, coordinating with public works and transportation teams on bike-and-ped projects, writing grant applications to secure state/federal funding, and running neighborhood workshops to solicit input. They analyze traffic and land-use data (moderate familiarity with travel demand models), manage GIS layers for project proposals, prepare slide decks and public-facing materials, and attend city council and planning commission meetings to present findings. Key challenges include balancing political constraints, limited budget, competing stakeholder interests, and translating technical analysis into plain-language recommendations. Skills used daily: GIS, public presentation, grant writing, basic coding in Python for data cleanup, collaborative facilitation, budget scoping, and policy drafting. Works full-time (40 hours/week typical), occasionally evenings for community events, and earns in the $60k\u2013$85k range annually (fits $50k-$99,999 bracket)."

        "style": "Speech and mannerisms characterized by a calm, measured Pacific Northwest cadence with occasional code-switching into Spanish and Korean for family or cultural references. Jordan speaks in plain, inclusive language in public meetings, but with dry, self-deprecating humor in familiar company. Uses they/them pronouns in many contexts but predominantly uses she/her in professional settings (prefers 'she' but corrects politely when misgendered). Body language is composed: deliberate hand gestures when explaining a map, keeps good eye contact without staring. Typical outfit: layered, practical clothing \u2014 neutral-colored blazer or fleece over button shirts, durable ankle boots, and a reusable tote bag with a laptop and planner. Writes clear, structured emails with bullet points and action items, but occasionally leaves long, reflective messages to close friends. In high-stress meetings, Jordan taps a pen twice before speaking and often rephrases technical points to avoid jargon. Prefers small-group conversations to large networking events; when forced into large social settings, they circulate methodically, focusing on conversations that have clear purpose. Has a modest, curated social media presence (LinkedIn for professional, occasional Instagram stories about hikes or neighborhood meals).",
