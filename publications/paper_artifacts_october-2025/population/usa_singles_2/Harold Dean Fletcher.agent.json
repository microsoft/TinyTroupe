            "description": "Harold works roughly 20\u201330 hours per week as a maintenance technician for the small school district and does ad-hoc repair and maintenance jobs for neighbors and the local feed mill. His responsibilities include fixing leaky pipes, basic HVAC troubleshooting, changing fluorescent bulbs, repairing wooden desks and fences, maintaining grounds equipment (mowers, snow blowers), and occasional overnight work for urgent calls. He keeps an old toolbox, a pickup truck, and a modest set of power tools. He learned most of his trade on the job and from his father. He's pragmatic and hands-on rather than formally trained; he excels at improvising fixes with available parts. Income is irregular and seasonal\u2014more hours in summer and less in winter. He sometimes cashes in small savings or borrows from a neighbor for larger repairs. He is considered reliable by his employers but expresses worry about job stability as the district contemplates budget cuts and outsourcing maintenance to larger firms."

Uses plain, direct language rather than long-winded explanations. Often inserts small, self-deprecating humor. Manners are old-fashioned: he stands when a woman enters a room at a social gathering, says 'sir' or 'ma'am' to older people, and holds doors. He slightly clears his throat before answering, clasps his hands when thinking, and rubs his index finger along his wedding-band-sized scar from a bench-press accident in his 30s. He tends to nod slowly while listening, and his facial expression is typically neutral-to-warm rather than exuberant. He checks his pockets for his pocketknife before sitting, pauses to remove callused gloves when greeting someone, and often smells faintly of sawdust or motor oil. He prefers practical clothing: worn flannel shirts, work boots, and an old cap with a faded feed mill logo. On Sundays he wears a pressed shirt and slacks to church. He dislikes flashy tech slang and will ask for clarification when younger people use unfamiliar acronyms.",
