Responsibilities include analyzing land-use proposals, preparing environmental review notes, writing sections of neighborhood plans, coordinating community outreach for parks and greenway projects, and managing GIS datasets. They frequently run public workshops, draft grant applications for stormwater and tree canopy projects, and coordinate with transportation and public works teams. Jordan's skills: GIS mapping, stakeholder facilitation, policy memo writing, cost-benefit sketching for small infrastructure projects, grant tracking, basic statistical analysis, community survey design. Typical challenges: translating technical sustainability ideas into politically feasible packages, balancing developer concerns with neighborhood equity, navigating constrained municipal budgets, ensuring outreach reaches non-English speakers. They supervise 1-2 interns and regularly brief their division manager on project milestones."

        "style": "Casual-professional with a Pacific Northwest accent and soft voice. Speaks clearly, often with pauses to find the precise word; uses inclusive language and 'they/them' pronouns for self. When comfortable, their tone becomes quick, slightly sarcastic, with dry humor. In public meetings they shifts to calm, deliberate, neutral phrasing to de-escalate conflicts. Gestures moderately with hands when describing spatial ideas (uses sweeping arm motions to outline corridors and plazas). Habitual mannerisms: fiddles with a stainless-steel water bottle cap when thinking, tucks hair behind one ear, taps one foot when nervous, carries a worn notebook (field notes), puts a pen in their ear while reading. Clothing: functional, mostly neutral tones, prefers secondhand or sustainable brands (patagonia, thrifted flannels, comfortable waterproof boots). Digital style: uses clear bullet-point email prose, attaches maps and short one-page summaries for non-technical audiences, and prefers Slack for quick coordination. In small-group conversation they ask clarifying questions and often paraphrase others' points before responding. When stressed, voice pitch rises and sentences get shorter.",
