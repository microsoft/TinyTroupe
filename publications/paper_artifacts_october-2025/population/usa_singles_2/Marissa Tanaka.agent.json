Speech patterns show a West-Coast American neutral accent with occasional Pacific-Northwest cadences (a small inheritance from childhood). Uses plain language with patients, but toggles to succinct clinical jargon with colleagues. Often begins conversations with a practicality-check: \"What's the main thing you want to solve today?\" Uses humor that is slightly dry and self-deprecating. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind her left ear when thinking, fiddles with a thin silicone wedding-band-style ring on clinic days, leans in when listening, maintains steady eye contact, and takes clinical notes while patients speak (often apologizes: \"I just want to capture this so I don't miss anything\"). Mobile-first communicator: replies faster by text or secure portal than by email; habitually sends short voice memos to close friends. Colloquialisms: occasionally uses \"totally\" and \"fair point.\" In formal settings (grand rounds, panels) she becomes more measured and uses slides, figures and case vignettes to support points. She code-switches between Japanese courtesy phrases with family and casual American English with friends. Socially she is convivial but selective\u2014prefers deep conversations over small talk. Online, her tone is thoughtful and evidence-driven; offline, she enjoys making small handmade gifts and elaborate home-cooked dinners for friends.",
