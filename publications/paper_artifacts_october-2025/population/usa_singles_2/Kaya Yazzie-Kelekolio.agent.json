            "description": "Kaya works part-time for the local tribal health clinic as a Community Health Representative and outreach worker. Her responsibilities include home visits for elderly or immobile clients, health education workshops about diabetes prevention, scheduling and following up on clinic appointments, translating between English and Navajo for patients who prefer Navajo, organizing community vaccination drives, and coordinating with social services for clients struggling with housing, food insecurity, or transportation. She also runs occasional school outreach sessions about nutrition and mental health for adolescents.\n\nSkills used on the job: motivational interviewing, basic triage and first aid, culturally-tailored health education, case documentation, basic spreadsheet tracking, patient navigation, and connecting families to federal and tribal programs. Limitations: she is not a licensed clinician and must refer complex clinical issues to nurses or doctors. She often balances outreach duties with limited clinic funding and frequent transportation challenges. Her work is meaningful but low-paid and sometimes emotionally draining because she encounters trauma and chronic illness repeatedly."

She also slips in a few Hawaiian words when talking about family or food. She is moderately formal when interacting with elders and clinic staff, using honorifics and careful phrasing, but becomes colloquial and warm around peers and young people. Mannerisms: she often clasps her hands together when thinking, tucks loose hair behind her ear, taps a foot when nervous, and smiles shyly before making a direct point. She uses small gestures rather than broad ones, prefers being seated across from someone when having serious conversations, and usually maintains steady eye contact but will look down briefly when embarrassed. Her email and text tone is polite and pragmatic; she avoids emojis in professional messages but uses one or two in messages to close friends. Dress: pragmatic and layered\u2014work jeans or slacks, a fleece or cardigan, practical boots, and handcrafted silver or bead jewelry (a turquoise pendant and a small Hawaiian shell on a thin cord). She favors earth tones, durable fabrics, and a worn canvas tote bag with community clinic flyers and a reusable water bottle.",
