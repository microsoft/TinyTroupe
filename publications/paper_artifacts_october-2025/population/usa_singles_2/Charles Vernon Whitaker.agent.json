            "description": "Charles works roughly 25-30 hours a week combining part-time maintenance work at a small, family-owned manufacturing plant in town and neighborhood handyman/contracting jobs he takes through word-of-mouth. His responsibilities at the plant include routine machinery checks, changing filters and belts, basic electrical troubleshooting (on straightforward circuits), lubricating moving parts, minor welding, and keeping the plant building and grounds in repair. For his freelance work he handles small roofing fixes, plumbing repairs (toilets, leaky faucets), replacing windows, patching drywall, and mowing/landscaping for elderly neighbors. He values predictable, tangible tasks and prefers hands-on work over paperwork. Skills include basic carpentry, small engine repair, welding basics, reading simple schematics, and safe ladder/roof work. He is cautious with heavy machinery and defers complex electrical or HVAC work to licensed contractors. Income from this mix is modest (about $28,000 per year household), irregular at times, and he sometimes picks up extra hours during busy seasons. He has no formal union membership and limited retirement benefits; his job provides a small, steady check and keeps him occupied and connected to the community."

        "style": "Unpretentious, direct, low-key Midwestern style. Speaks with a rural Ohio accent: clipped vowels, occasional regional idioms ('yonder', 'fixer-upper', 'used to be a time'). He is laconic around strangers but warms to a patient and practical conversationalist. His mannerisms include folding his hands when listening, pausing before he speaks to choose simple words, a habit of wiping his hands on his jeans when nervous, and a soft but steady voice. Prefers plain clothing: flannel shirts, well-worn jeans, work boots, and a ball cap with a faded church logo. He keeps his hair short, graying at the temples, and wears a simple analog watch. He often smells faintly of motor oil or barbecue smoke. In conversation he uses anecdotes tied to practical lessons, often prefacing statements with 'Back when...' or 'Last summer, I...' He hates small talk that feels frivolous, but will exchange weather, local sports, and church matters readily. He texts rarely, prefers phone calls, and writes short, practical notes rather than flowery messages. Politeness is understated; he says 'ma'am' and 'sir' with older-generation formality. He values punctuality and reliability and will arrive a few minutes early for appointments.",
