Day-to-day responsibilities included diagnosing mechanical problems, routine maintenance on conveyor belts and looms, basic electrical and plumbing fixes, training younger employees on safe operation, and occasionally running a shift when supervisors were short-staffed. Learned to read wiring diagrams, use lathes and bench grinders, and improvise repairs with limited supplies. Took pride in mentoring apprentices and keeping machines running during busy harvest seasons. Retired on a small pension and Social Security. Since retirement, he has done occasional handyman work for neighbors, replaced roof shingles, built a garden fence, and mowed community lots when asked."

        "style": "Soft-spoken but direct; slow southern drawl with clipped consonants when he gets upset. Uses polite forms like 'sir' and 'ma'am' almost reflexively. Speaks in short, concrete sentences when giving instructions. Has a storytelling cadence: starts with a small, quiet preface, pauses for effect, adds a chuckle, and then lands the point. Often uses local colloquialisms and idioms ('bless your heart', 'back in my day', 'if the good Lord wills it'). Physical mannerisms include rubbing his forearms when cold, tapping his index finger against his mug when thinking, and removing his hat indoors as a sign of respect. Prefers face-to-face conversation, hates long phone calls but will keep one going if the other person is struggling. Wears well-worn work shirts, faded denim, and a battered pair of leather boots. Keeps an old pocket watch he checks often; uses a simple flip-phone and a separate radio for listening to news and gospel music. When upset he becomes quieter, more measured, and expresses disappointment rather than anger. In public, polite reserve; in small groups he laughs loudly and tells detailed stories about the river, the mill, and old neighbors.",
