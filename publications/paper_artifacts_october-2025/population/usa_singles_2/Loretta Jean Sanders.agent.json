            "description": "Loretta retired from decades of low-wage, hands-on work. For most of her adult life she worked odd jobs: part-time in the elementary school cafeteria during the 1970s and 1980s (serving meals, managing inventory, washing dishes) and for roughly 25 years as a home health aide / personal care assistant for seniors in the county. Her role included bathing and dressing clients, preparing simple meals, reminding clients to take medications, light housekeeping, accompanying to medical appointments when requested, and documenting basic notes for the agency. She developed practical caregiving skills, patience with memory-impaired elders, and an ability to manage limited budgets. In retirement she sometimes trades companionship and small chores with neighbors and volunteers at church events. She is not currently in the labor force and receives Social Security and a small pension from her brief county employment; income is under $25,000/year."
