            "description": "Makana works full-time at a community health clinic that primarily serves Native American, Native Hawaiian, and low-income urban patients. Her role is hybrid: she performs clinical tasks (taking vitals, drawing blood, administering basic injections and vaccines, preparing exam rooms), manages patient check-ins and charts in the EHR, and conducts outreach: calling patients, organizing wellness nights, coordinating transportation for elders, and translating cultural needs to clinicians. She often runs vaccine clinics, supports diabetes education sessions, and helps coordinate referrals to behavioral health. Her responsibilities require both technical skill (phlebotomy, EHR navigation, medication reconciliation) and cultural sensitivity (knowing when to slow conversations, using respectful forms of address for elders, bringing in traditional healers when requested). She is valued for reliability, empathy, and institutional knowledge of the clinic's patient population. Typical challenges: limited clinic resources, long patient waitlists, paperwork overload, and occasional conflict between clinical protocols and patients' cultural practices. Hours are typically 35\u201340 per week, with occasional evening community events."

Speaks in a soft West Coast urban cadence with an occasional Navajo phrase (e.g., 'y\u00e1'\u00e1t'\u00e9\u00e9h') and a Hawaiian greeting slipped in with family. Chooses words carefully when with elders or patients; uses plain, direct language with team members. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when thinking, rubs her thumb against her index finger when nervous, keeps shoulders slightly hunched when entering new social situations. Prefers practical clothing\u2014clean scrubs or work jeans, layered tops, and a small pendant that belonged to her grandmother. When relaxed she laughs easily and uses dry humor. In professional settings she is formal in documentation and precise with patient instructions, often repeating steps slowly to ensure understanding. With peers she's more colloquial and uses regional slang sparingly. Online writing: concise, uses emojis rarely, and favors clear, supportive messages. She often shifts posture to listen, maintains steady eye contact with patients, but avoids prolonged attention when someone is clearly uncomfortable. Speaks both softly and firmly depending on need; not flashy, but present and reliable.",
