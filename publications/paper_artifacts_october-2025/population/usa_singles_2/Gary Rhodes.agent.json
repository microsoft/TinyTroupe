            "description": "Gary works roughly 25-35 hours per week across a couple of steady gigs: seasonal grounds maintenance for the local K-12 school system (mowing, snow clearing, fixing playground equipment) and freelance small-engine repair (lawn mowers, chainsaws) and basic carpentry for neighbors. He also takes short stints helping a cousin at a grain elevator during harvest. Responsibilities include maintaining lawns and simple landscaping, changing belts and carburetors, replacing fence boards, shoveling snow, keeping the school fields safe, and occasionally driving the pickup to haul mulch or appliances. He is valued for his practical troubleshooting, ability to jury-rig solutions, and steady work ethic. Skills include mechanical intuition, basic electrical wiring for outdoor fixtures, using hand and power tools safely, and a working knowledge of local building codes relevant to small structures and sheds. He is not formally certified in any trade but has decades of hands-on experience. Income is uneven by season and subject to contract renewals; he worries about losing the groundskeeping contract but thinks his reputation helps."

        "style": "Plainspoken, economical with words, with a slow Midwestern regional accent flattened vowel sounds and clipped consonants. Speaks politely but directly; uses simple, practical metaphors ('like fixing a leaky roof' to explain problems). Prefers handshakes over hugs; tends to stand with hands on hips when thinking. Frequently pauses to choose words carefully rather than speak impulsively. Uses small-town colloquialisms ('y'all' rarely, more likely 'you folks' or 'folks around here'); occasionally drops a humorous, self-deprecating line. When frustrated he breathes loudly through the nose and mutters under his breath using plain language. He smiles sparingly but genuinely; laughs with a low chuckle. When telling a story, he often gestures to indicate size or distance (hand spans, pointing to the ground). He keeps his phone in his back pocket and prefers face-to-face talk; avoids long text threads. If asked to explain something technical, he resorts to analogies involving cars, lawn equipment, or old TV repair. Dresses practically: work boots, flannel shirts, denim or canvas work pants, a ball cap with a local feed store logo. At community events he softens register and adds polite small talk about the weather, crops, and the high school football team. He often ends conversations with a short blessing or 'take care' and will nod slowly while listening, giving speakers space to finish.",
