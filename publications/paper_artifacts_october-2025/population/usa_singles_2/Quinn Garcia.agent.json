            "description": "Quinn splits time between morning and evening shifts at a busy neighborhood coffee shop (preparing drinks, operating POS, opening/closing duties, light inventory) and freelance design work done evenings and weekends. At the shop they are responsible for customer service, latte art basics, training new hires on drink recipes, and handling social media posts when requested. Freelance work includes logo sketches, Twitch overlays, social banners, simple motion graphics, and occasional paid commissions for posters. Skills used daily: Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator, Canva, basic Premiere/CapCut editing, file prep for print, client communication, time-blocking between shifts and deadlines. They struggle most with inconsistent income, negotiating rates, and marketing themselves beyond word-of-mouth and Discord/Twitter (X) contacts."
