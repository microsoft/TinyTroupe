            "description": "Ra\u00fal runs a small, family-oriented convenience store in a middle-class suburban colonia of Zapopan. He opens early, sources products from a mix of wholesalers and local distributors, negotiates credit with a nearby abarrotes supplier, and manages day-to-day operations including stocking, pricing, customer service, and simple bookkeeping. Responsibilities include cash handling, ordering, rotating perishables (bread, dairy), preparing a small selection of ready-to-eat items (tortas, tamales on certain days), supervising one part-time helper (his nephew on weekends), and dealing with municipal inspectors. He balances formal receipts with a majority of cash transactions. He knows how to read supplier invoices, keep a daily cash journal, and file basic tax paperwork when necessary, but he prefers to remain small rather than scale rapidly. He sometimes does occasional catering or supplies beverages to a local fonda and helps neighbors with small delivery runs using his motorcycle.",

If pressured or lied to (e.g., by a supplier), becomes firm and refuses repeat business. Trust is transactional: quick to forgive minor slights but slow to trust again on financial matters."
