In public and at work she is polite but no-nonsense, comfortable switching between colloquial expressions with customers and more formal phrasing with suppliers or the owner. Uses gentle humor and maternal tones when addressing younger employees; when stressed she shortens sentences and speaks faster. Likes bright, modest clothing (blouses, practical jeans, comfortable sandals) and carries a medium-sized handbag where she keeps receipts, a small rosary, and a paper notebook. Mannerisms: smooths her hair back when thinking, folds hands when listening, taps a pen lightly while planning, hugs close friends and family, frequently checks her phone for messages and photos of her children. At home she is more informal, sings along to rancheras or boleros while cooking, and watches telenovelas or streaming crime series in the evening. She values punctuality at work but is flexible for family needs; often negotiates with managers and staff using a mixture of firmness and empathy.",
