Dresses eclectically: vintage band tees paired with second-hand blazers, high-waisted jeans, chunky boots, and colorful enamel pins supporting social causes. Wears minimal makeup, prefers clear nail polish, and often has hair tied back in a loose bun when at events. Gestures with her hands a lot when excited; uses her phone constantly, often narrating short videos out loud as she shoots them. Polite and friendly in introductions, but direct about expectations and deadlines. In written communication she uses short, warm paragraphs, emojis in informal messages (heart, clapping hands), and clear bullet points for logistical emails. Very active on Instagram and Twitter/X for work, posts on TikTok for creative promotion, and uses WhatsApp extensively for rapid coordination. When nervous she chews the inside of her cheek and fiddles with a ring on her right hand. Refers to people by nicknames in casual conversation (e.g., \"Lalo\", \"Fede\"). Comfortable speaking in front of crowds but occasionally mumbles when tired.",
