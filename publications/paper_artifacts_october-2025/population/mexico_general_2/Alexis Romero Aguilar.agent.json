            "description": "Formally employed part-time as Social Media & Community Manager at a neighborhood cultural space that runs workshops, concerts and micro-festivals. Responsibilities include: planning and executing social media campaigns (Instagram, TikTok, Facebook), community engagement (WhatsApp groups, mailing lists), event programming coordination, volunteer management, light budgeting and reporting for municipal cultural grants, coordinating with local musicians and artists, and on-site logistics during events. Outside that role she freelances as a graphic designer for small businesses, DJs at local bars/festivals occasionally, and sells zines and prints through an online shop. Her employment is a hybrid of formal part-time contract and informal freelance work; she invoices clients irregularly and sometimes receives cash payments for weekend gigs. Key skills used professionally: content strategy, copywriting in Spanish and some English, basic social analytics (Meta Business Suite, Canva analytics, Google Analytics lite), Adobe Illustrator/Photoshop, event logistics, small-scale grant applications, negotiation with vendors, and light audio mixing for DJ sets. Main occupational challenges: irregular income, navigating bureaucracy for cultural permits, balancing creative work with administrative reporting, and finding health insurance continuity between jobs."
