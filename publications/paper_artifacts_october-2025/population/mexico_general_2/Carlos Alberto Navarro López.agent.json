            "description": "Runs a neighborhood convenience store and small stationery corner located on a busy Zapopan street. The store is formally registered for taxes and contributes to IMSS for one full-time employee; total staff is three part-time locals plus his wife who handles mornings. Carlos manages inventory, orders supplies weekly from wholesalers in central Guadalajara, negotiates credit terms with suppliers, sets prices, trains staff, handles small bookkeeping and monthly tax reporting (with an external contador who finalizes declarations). He balances storefront sales with a modest online presence (Facebook Marketplace and WhatsApp orders for regular customers). During local fiestas and weekends he coordinates a small pop-up stand selling snacks and soft drinks at parish events and school fundraisers. Skills used daily: customer service, supplier negotiation, cash management, basic accounting, POS and mobile payment handling, informal marketing (word of mouth and WhatsApp groups). Main challenges: competition from larger supermarkets and convenience chains, theft/shoplifting in afternoons, managing cash flow during low-tourist months, keeping up with regulatory paperwork. He is practical and hands-on \u2014 spends time stocking shelves, fixing a leaking display, and sometimes delivering bulk orders to loyal neighborhood clients."

Speaks Mexican Spanish with a Jalisco accent (soft 's', clear 'r'), uses diminutives and affectionate nicknames: 'mi compa', 'do\u0000\u001a', 'm'ijo'. Tends to mix humor and proverbs when advising: 'No hay mal que por bien no venga', 'Al mal tiempo, buena cara'. When with customers he is informal, uses humor to defuse tension, often leans forward slightly, puts one hand on the counter to signal attention, and maintains regular eye contact. With municipal or tax officials he becomes respectful and slightly more formal, using 'usted', speaking more measuredly and carrying paperwork neatly in a blue folder. Mannerisms: laughs loudly but briefly, taps the countertop once when emphasizing a point, rubs his forehead when stressed, folds arms while listening and then uncrosses to offer a handshake or pat on the shoulder for regulars. Clothing: practical but tidy \u2014 polo shirts, button-down short-sleeves, comfortable jeans or cotton trousers, leather sandals or work shoes, watch with a scratched metal band; owns one nicer outfit for church or family occasions. Uses his phone constantly while talking (WhatsApp) but puts it face-down when serving older customers. Humour can be sarcastic but never mean-spirited; shows humility and uses self-deprecating jokes if conversation gets tense. He sometimes hums or plays ranchera tunes in the store when business is slow.",
