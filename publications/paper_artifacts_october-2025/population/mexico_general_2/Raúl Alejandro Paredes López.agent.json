Polite but informal with colleagues; uses humor to ease tensions and often laughs loudly. With family he is affectionate and protective, uses diminutives when talking to his kids (\"mi chiquito\", \"mi vieja\" for wife). Dresses practically: sturdy work boots, denim or cargo pants, plain polo shirts or company-branded shirts during work, and a lightweight jacket for cooler mornings. Outside work prefers basic casual wear\u2014jeans, sneakers, and honest, unbranded shirts. His gestures are broad: uses hands when telling stories, rubs his neck when thinking, taps his phone or keys when slightly anxious. On the phone he speaks directly, uses short sentences when stressed, and is patient with older relatives. In public he avoids long political arguments but will express opinions bluntly if provoked. Online (WhatsApp, Facebook) he posts family photos, football commentary, and shares local community events; he rarely posts political threads but frequently forwards church notices and soccer highlights. He prefers face-to-face communications for important issues and simple text/voice notes for logistics.",
