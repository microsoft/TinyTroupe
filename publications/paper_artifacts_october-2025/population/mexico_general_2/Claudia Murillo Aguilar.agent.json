            "description": "Claudia runs a small informal business in a busy neighborhood market near Puebla's municipal transit hub. She operates early mornings and afternoons, selling an assortment of items: tamales and atole on market days, packaged snacks, affordable blouses, scarves and costume jewelry, and seasonal items (school supplies, holiday decorations). Her work is entirely informal (no registered business, no employee benefits). She sources goods from small wholesalers in the city and occasionally buys on consignment from a cousin who brings items from Mexico City. Responsibilities include: preparing food on-site (when she sells snacks), procuring inventory weekly, negotiating prices with wholesalers, setting up and cleaning the stall, tallying daily cash, handling customer relations, and helping family with household tasks. She sometimes hires a younger cousin to help on Saturdays and during festivals. Her skills include negotiation, quick mental math for cash transactions, basic food preparation, and reading customer preferences. Income is variable: some weeks she earns enough to cover bills and put aside a small amount; other weeks she struggles to cover both business costs and household expenses. She occasionally uses informal credit from a local tienda or buys on credit from wholesalers."

Speaks central Mexican Spanish with Puebla-district colloquialisms and a slight tendency to use diminutives when addressing children and customers (\"mi amorcito\", \"un momentito\"). Polite and chatty with regular clients; when stressed she speaks more abruptly but tries to soften it with humor. Body language is expressive \u2014 she gestures with her hands while telling stories, tilts her head when listening, and leans forward to make a sale. In the market she dresses in bright, practical clothes: a clean apron over a cotton blouse, comfortable sandals, and always a small cross necklace. When meeting church friends or extended family she adds a shawl and light makeup. On WhatsApp and Facebook she writes in a friendly, emoji-filled tone, posts photos of meals and family gatherings, and uses voice notes when she\u2019s in a hurry. Her manner is informal with most people but respectful toward elders and authority figures (priests, local officials).
