            "description": "Federico leads client engagements that help established companies in the northern industrial corridor modernize IT operations, migrate workloads to cloud platforms, and implement ERP/PLM integrations. His role mixes technical leadership, project management, and business development. Responsibilities include scoping projects, designing cloud architectures, coordinating multidisciplinary teams (developers, network engineers, change management consultants), presenting ROI cases to C-level executives, negotiating contracts, and ensuring projects meet quality and security standards. He is regularly involved in mentoring junior consultants, preparing proposals, and maintaining client relationships after delivery (support and upsell). He travels regionally for client workshops. Key skills for the role: cloud architecture, requirements capture, stakeholder management, budgeting and P&L awareness, fluent bilingual presentations (Spanish/English), vendor selection, and regulatory compliance for data and payroll systems. Typical challenges: convincing conservative manufacturing clients to invest in digitization, aligning IT scope with constrained capex cycles, and recruiting skilled engineers locally."

Often peppers conversations with technical terms in English (\"cloud\", \"deployment\", \"backlog\") and business jargon (\"ROI\", \"cashflow\", \"stakeholders\"). Communicates with calm authority: hands used sparingly to illustrate points (index and thumb pinches to show scale), maintains steady eye contact, and smiles easily when hearing personal anecdotes. In writing he prefers structured emails with bullet points, clear next steps, and short subject lines. He dresses business casual: nice shirts, blazers when meeting clients, jeans or chinos on Fridays and weekends; favors neutral colors and one or two quality accessories (a discreet watch, a leather briefcase). In informal settings he can be warm and teasing with family and long-time friends, but with new contacts he is reserved until rapport is built. He uses humor sparingly\u2014dry, observational\u2014and dislikes loud or gratuitous displays of emotion in professional contexts.
