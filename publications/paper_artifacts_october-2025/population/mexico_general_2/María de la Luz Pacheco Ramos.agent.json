            "description": "Primary occupation is running a 1.5-hectare family plot where she grows maize, beans, various seasonal vegetables (tomato, chiles, squash), and a small orchard of citrus and guava. She manages planting cycles, seed selection (including saved local seed), pest control using traditional methods, and harvest coordination. She and her husband share responsibilities: he does heavier plowing and construction while she tends seedlings, transplanting, and post-harvest processing.\n\nTo supplement farm income she takes informal day labor (jornal) in nearby fields during harvests or works as a vendor two days a week at the municipal market selling vegetables and homemade tortillas. She also prepares and sells tamales and seasonal preserves during fiestas. Her role requires skills in manual farming, bargaining at market, basic weighing and cash handling, simple bookkeeping in a notebook, coordinating child care, and negotiating informal credit (conchero/tienda on credit). She occasionally works with a local NGO on collective seed banks and has been a point person for women's training sessions once a month.\n\nStrengths: practical agricultural knowledge, bargaining, multi-tasking, hands-on processing (cooking, preserving), community relationships. Limitations: no formal contract work, irregular cash flow, limited access to formal credit or agricultural extension services, limited digital literacy beyond basic WhatsApp and calls."
