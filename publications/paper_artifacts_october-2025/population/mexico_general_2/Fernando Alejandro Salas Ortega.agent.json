            "description": "Fernando is a senior-level technologist who combines systems architecture, integration design and client-facing consulting. He leads a small technical team (3-6 engineers) responsible for integrating payment rails, designing secure APIs, and ensuring regulatory compliance for data protection. He translates business product requirements into technical specifications, estimates project timelines, coordinates with product managers and with the compliance/legal teams, and occasionally represents the company in meetings with banks and government entities. He participates in hiring, mentors junior engineers, and helps shape technical strategy. He writes proof-of-concept code, reviews pull requests, designs cloud infrastructure (primarily AWS), and prepares technical proposals for enterprise clients. His work requires both deep technical skills (microservices, databases, security) and soft skills (negotiation, risk assessment, stakeholder management)."
