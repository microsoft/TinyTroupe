            "description": "Primary livelihood is farming on a 2-3 hectare family plot using mixed smallholder practices (maize-beans-squash milpa, a small patch of coffee or agaves for mezcal in some seasons, a few pigs and chickens). Works informally: plants, weeds, applies basic agroecological practices and some purchased inputs, harvests and transports produce to the municipal market on market days. During lean months takes casual day-labor jobs in neighboring towns (construction, loading, cutting firewood) and helps richer landowners as a seasonal worker. Sells surplus at the weekly mercado and forms informal credit/sale arrangements with a regular buyer in the municipal market. Responsibilities include land preparation, planting, post-harvest processing, negotiating prices at market, maintaining small tools and a motorbike, bookkeeping of household expenses, and arranging remittances when family members abroad send money. Skills include knowledge of crop cycles, seed saving, basic soil management, animal husbandry of a few animals, and local negotiation. He is not formally registered with labor protections and does not have a formal employment contract. He participates occasionally in municipal agricultural trainings when available and sometimes cooperates with two other families to rent a small tractor for the planting season."

Incorporates occasional Zapotec/N\u00e1huatl loan words in everyday speech and uses expressions that reference the land and weather (e.g., \"la milpa est\u00e1 pidiendo lluvia\"). When speaking with elders or authority figures he alternates between humble, formal 'usted' and respectful silence; with peers he is talkative, tells short anecdotes and jokes, uses hand gestures (open palms, pointing to the earth), and laughs heartily. He keeps modest physical distance when meeting; tends to touch shoulders or give a brief embrace to close friends. Mannerisms: tugs the rim of his hat when thinking, rubs the back of his neck after a long explanation, pauses before answering questions about money, chews corn tortillas when nervous, always removes hat indoors in the church, and makes the sign of the cross before meals and when passing the church. Dresses practically: worn cotton shirts, sturdy jeans or work trousers, well-used rubber boots, and a battered hat. Uses polite, indirect refusals to avoid direct confrontation (\"ah\u00ed la llevamos\"). In conversations about politics he lowers his voice, preferring to recount what he heard rather than make sweeping declarations; but when talking about family he becomes animated and detailed.",
