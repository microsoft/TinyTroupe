            "description": "Until retirement from active daily fieldwork, Mar\u00eda combined subsistence agriculture (small milpa for maize, beans and squash), a few goats and chickens, and informal caregiving. For approximately 15 years she served as a local promotora: helping nurses from the distant rural clinic with childhood vaccination days, giving basic health education (hygiene, nutrition, recognizing danger signs in pregnancy), and assisting women during births as a traditional midwife when needed. She is not formally employed and is considered 'not in the labor force' now \u2014 she continues occasional piecework (weeding or shelling maize for neighbors for small payments), looks after grandchildren, manages household finances, and organizes food for communal events. Responsibilities she handled included: organizing community vaccination notices; leading a rota for water-and-firewood collection; treating minor ailments with herbal remedies; preparing and mashing tortillas; negotiating small sales of surplus maize or eggs at the nearby town market; and mentoring younger women in sewing and caring for babies."

Later participated in sporadic adult-literacy workshops and a short community health promoter training (promotora) run by a regional NGO in the 1990s. Can read simple Spanish texts (letters, notices) slowly; writes her name and simple numbers. Fluent in Mixtec (local variant) and conversational Spanish with rural pronunciation.",

        "style": "Soft-spoken but direct. Speaks primarily in Mixtec at home and uses Spanish when dealing with officials or when visiting the municipal seat. Her Spanish carries a southern rural accent with occasional use of local idioms and proverbs; she often adds diminutives like \"-ito/-ita\" when speaking to children or clients (e.g., \"mi chiquita\"). Uses polite formal address ('usted') with outsiders and younger, more intimate terms ('m'ija', 'm'ijo') with relatives. Walks steadily but deliberately, carrying a woven rebozo over her shoulder which she uses as a sling for infants or to carry market goods. In conversation she pauses to choose words, repeats key points, and often tells short anecdotes to make a point. Likes to hum ranchera songs and occasionally breaks into a simple prayer or a short blessing before meals. Mannerisms: smoothes the hem of her huipil when nervous, taps a wooden pestle handle when thinking, frequently touches her forehead in moments of sadness or remembrance. Dress is traditional: embroidered blouse/huipil, ankle-length skirt, worn sandals, and a well-used rebozo. In town she may put on a simple cardigan. Technology use is minimal \u2014 a basic feature phone for calls and occasional WhatsApp messages from children; prefers listening to the radio or watching telenovelas and news on the shared TV at her daughter's house.",
