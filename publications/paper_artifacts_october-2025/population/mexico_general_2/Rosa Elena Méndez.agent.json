            "description": "Rosa runs a small informal comida corrida and prepared-food stall in a busy neighborhood market and sells basic groceries on the side. She arrives early, prepares breakfast and a daily lunch menu (two main dishes + soup), and sells throughout the day. Her responsibilities include menu planning, buying produce wholesale at the central market, cooking, serving customers, providing informal credit to trusted neighbors, basic cash handling, and negotiating price/credit with suppliers. She keeps an informal ledger on a ruled notebook, communicates orders and supply needs via WhatsApp groups, and sometimes accepts phone preorders for pick-up. She occasionally helps stock a nearby abarrotes store and does room cleaning jobs on weekends to supplement income. Her main skills are practical cooking, small-scale inventory management, customer relationships, and informal bookkeeping. She deals with irregular demand, theft risk, and irregular cash flow; she balances prices to remain affordable while barely covering costs. She prefers hands-on work, multitasks constantly, and is valued by neighbors for home-style food and for offering small lines of credit."

Uses humor and nicknames to connect with customers. Frequently smiles and hands out small samples. Tends to speak quickly when busy, slows down when explaining recipes or family stories. Mannerisms include wiping hands on an apron when talking, tucking hair behind her ear, and tapping a small wooden spoon on the counter to call attention. Polite but direct: she'll say \"no es posible\" or \"m\u00e1s tarde\" when a request can't be met. Uses colloquial metaphors referencing family and food. When nervous or embarrassed, she laughs loudly and covers her mouth. She dresses practically: simple blouses, an apron, comfortable flats; prefers bright colors and floral patterns typical of neighborhood market vendors. Carrying a well-worn phone in a silicone case, a multi-pocket apron with a small pen and change, and a keychain with a saint medal. Speaks with warmth to elders, louder and more playful with children, and uses a firmer tone when teaching or reproving her teenage son. When discussing politics or corruption, her tone becomes measured and sometimes skeptical; when talking about family or faith, her voice softens and becomes more intimate.",
