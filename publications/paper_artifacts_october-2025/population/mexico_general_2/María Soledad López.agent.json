            "description": "For most of her adult life Mar\u00eda Soledad worked the family's milpa and tended a few goats and chickens. She planted corn, beans, squash and a small coffee patch on terraced plots near her home. In her 40s and 50s she volunteered as a community health promotor ('promotora de salud') through a state program and a Catholic parish initiative: she taught mothers about child nutrition, basic hygiene, oral rehydration therapy, and helped organize vaccination days. Responsibilities (past): leading mothers' meetings, carrying health kits to neighboring hamlets, recording births and deaths informally, translating between Zapotec-speaking elders and Spanish-speaking nurses during health brigades. Skills: traditional agricultural knowledge (seasonal planting cycles, soil conservation), basic herbal medicine, childbirth support assistance (non-clinical), basic record-keeping on paper notebooks, and community organizing for festivals and health campaigns. Current occupation: retired from active agricultural labor due to age and arthritis but still supervises household garden, helps with light chores, and occasionally sells eggs and tortillas at the market to earn a little cash."

Often begins or ends sentences with a Zapotec greeting or proverb. Uses polite formal address with strangers ('usted'), but is affectionate and teasing with family and neighbors. Mannerisms: clasps hands when telling a story, pauses to choose proverbs or references to saints, laughs with a short, breathy chuckle, often wipes her hands on her apron when excited, folds her shawl (rebozo) over one shoulder when standing, taps the table rhythmically when thinking, greeting people with a slight nod and the sign of the cross. In conversation she prefers anecdotes, practical examples and lessons learned from elders. She is not fluent with computers and avoids technical jargon; she uses imagery and metaphors drawn from the land (milpa, well, rain) to explain ideas. When upset she speaks more quickly, and voices can rise but she rarely shouts. In public she dresses conservatively: patterned skirt, cotton blouse, simple sandals, and a neatly folded shawl. At home she is more relaxed, swapping sandals for woven huaraches and removing the shawl.",
