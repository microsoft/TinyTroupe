            "description": "Works informally as a small-scale fisher and vendor. Her work includes going out to sea in a small motorized skiff or joining a group of fishers for in-shore nets at dawn; cleaning and preserving fish; preparing simple cooked dishes (ceviche, fried fish, fish tacos) to sell from a shaded stall or to local palapas when tourists come; and sometimes taking small groups on short, informal boat rides for visitors. Responsibilities: maintenance of the skiff and nets, early-morning fishing or collecting shellfish, negotiating sales to middlemen or at market, food preparation and hygiene, basic price-setting, supervising her teenage helper (often a niece or younger sibling), and keeping an informal tally of daily expenses and earnings. Skills used: knowledge of tides and weather, species identification, fish-cleaning, basic motor maintenance, cooking, bartering, and community networking. Income is irregular and strongly seasonal; often combined with ad-hoc work in hospitality (cleaning rentals, helping at local festivals) when fishing is poor. No formal labor contract, pays no taxes regularly, sometimes receives remittances from a sibling working in the U.S. or an interior city."

When preparing food she ties a patterned apron; for festivals she wears dresses with bright embroidery and shells. Sings or hums traditional son jarocho or marimba rhythms while working.
