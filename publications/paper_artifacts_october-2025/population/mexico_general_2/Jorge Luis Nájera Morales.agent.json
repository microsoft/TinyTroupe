Gestures with his hands while explaining products; half-smile and nod often accompany his speech. In the store he is customer-friendly, uses plain language rather than technical jargon, and often tells short anecdotes to build rapport (\"a m\u00ed me pas\u00f3 lo mismo\"). He switches to a slightly more formal register when dealing with suppliers, banks, or official procedures. When stressed, his speech speeds up and he repeats details to ensure understanding; when relaxed he speaks slowly and laughs aloud at small jokes. He checks his phone frequently between customers and uses WhatsApp voice notes to coordinate family and staff. Prefers comfortable, neat clothing\u2014collared polo shirts, jeans or slacks, and leather shoes; wears a simple analog wristwatch. On special occasions he dresses more formally (button-down shirt, blazer). Has a habit of wiping his hands on a towel or apron when coming back from deliveries or carrying boxes.",
