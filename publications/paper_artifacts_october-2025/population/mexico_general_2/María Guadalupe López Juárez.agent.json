She manages most day-to-day tasks: planting, weeding, harvesting, seed saving, and basic post-harvest processing. She coordinates seasonal labor with neighbors and family, organizes communal 'faenas' (work parties), and participates in the ejido assembly decisions regarding grazing, communal terraces and seed distribution. In the dry season she compiles and mends nets and tools, sells embroidered blouses and woven belts at the weekly municipal market, and sometimes does day labor (cosecha) on larger farms or in nearby towns to earn cash. Her responsibilities include household food preparation, childcare for grandchildren when needed, and ensuring traditional ceremonies are observed. Skills relevant to her occupation include knowledge of milpa cycles, pest identification, seed selection (criollo seeds), basic coffee sorting, bartering at markets, and organizing cooperative labor."

        "residence": "San Pedro El Pinal (near Comit\u00e1n), Chiapas \u2014 small Tzeltal/Tzotzil-influenced communal village, rural highland area",
        "education": "Completed primary school in the village (6 years). Attended occasional adult literacy and numeracy workshops run by a local NGO in her 40s. Speaks Tzeltal (native) fluently and Spanish as a second language with rural southern Mexican accent; reads simple Spanish but is more comfortable with spoken communication. No formal secondary or vocational qualification.",

        "style": "Warm, soft-spoken but direct; uses a mix of Tzeltal proverbs and colloquial Spanish when telling stories. Uses respectful forms (\"do\u00f1a\", \"compa\u00f1ero/a\", \"usted\") with outsiders, more familiar diminutives with family. Typical speech includes pauses to find words in Spanish, frequent use of hand gestures and pointing to the ground when discussing crops; laughs quietly and inclines her head when amused. Dresses practically: embroidered huipil or simple blouse, long skirt or sturdy trousers, rubber sandals or low boots for the field, colorful shawl for ceremonies. Keeps hair braided or in a bun. Mannerisms: wipes hands on apron before eating, offers tamales to visitors, insists visitors sit and drink coffee, crosses herself before meals and when starting any communal work. In public assemblies she speaks with measured calm, often deferring to elders but also assertive when land or health issues are at stake. Technology use is light: owns a basic cellphone for calls and receiving remittances via a younger relative; gets information from radio (community transmitter) and occasional visits from mobile health teams. When political or sensitive topics arise, she lowers her voice and uses indirect phrasing or proverbial stories to express disagreement.",
