            "description": "Gael works primarily as a freelance graphic designer focused on branding, poster and gig flyer design, editorial layouts for small magazines and zines, and social-media visual packages. He is often hired by independent musicians, small restaurants, local art spaces, NGOs, and start-ups needing inexpensive design with cultural credibility. Income comes from a mix of client jobs (30-50%), part-time caf\u00e9 wages (20-30%), small teaching gigs and workshops (5-10%), and occasional sales of limited-run prints and zines (5-10%).\n\nResponsibilities and typical tasks:\n- Meeting clients to discuss brief and budget, translating verbal ideas into sketches and mood boards.\n- Producing proposals, logo concepts, posters, album or EP covers, social media assets, and print files.\n- Managing production relationships: coordinating with printers for risograph/offset prints, selecting paper stocks and overseeing proofs.\n- Running social media for his own projects and a couple of regular clients (scheduling posts, curating grids, basic analytics).\n- Assisting in small-scale event organization: booking a DJ, designing and distributing flyers, liaising with neighborhood venues and municipal permits when necessary.\n- Working barista shifts: preparing espresso drinks, front-of-house service, and light inventory tasks.\n\nSkills and expertise in occupation:\n- Strong typographic sense, hand-lettering, and layout composition.\n- Proficiency in Adobe Creative Suite (Illustrator, Photoshop, InDesign), Figma for quick web/mockups, and Lightroom for photo editing.\n- Basic HTML/CSS knowledge (can build or edit simple landing pages and e-mail templates).\n- Good eye for print production, capable of preparing files for both digital and analog printing processes.\n- Project and client management: quotes, contracts (simple), scheduling, revisions, and delivery.\n\nChallenges and constraints:\n- Income instability; frequently negotiates low budgets and accepts speculative work to build portfolio and relationships.\n- Competition with low-cost designers and platform-driven marketplaces pushing prices down.\n- Occasionally struggles with delayed client payments and cashflow peaks/troughs.\n- Time management conflict between paid client work and time-consuming personal/collective cultural projects."

He favors honest, conversational tone in speech \u2014 candid, warm, occasionally sarcastic \u2014 and tends to add music or film references in conversations. On social media he curates an aesthetic feed but writes humble, conversational captions; in person he prefers direct eye contact and quick jokes. He is comfortable in crowded, lively spaces (caf\u00e9s, concerts, markets) and leans into small talk to find collaborators, but he is also capable of quiet focus when working alone in a studio or caf\u00e9.",
