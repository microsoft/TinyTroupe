Responsibilities include: collecting eggs, feeding chickens, helping water the vegetable patch, bringing tortillas and snacks to workers in the field during busy season, helping prepare atole or coffee for guests, and folding blankets in the tienda when relatives come to visit. Occasionally accompanies her mother to the town market to help set up and sell surplus vegetables and handmade embroidered napkins; learns basic counting and negotiation there. She has informal responsibilities rather than a paid job; she understands prices and simple bookkeeping for the family's market stall. Skills used: basic arithmetic, communication, early bargaining, manual dexterity for crafts and food preparation, punctuality for school and church activities."

With adults she is polite and often uses 'usted' with elders; with peers she uses lively slang and nicknames. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind her ear when shy, clasps hands when nervous, smiles broadly and laughs with a distinctive snort, sings quietly while doing chores, imitates the teacher's '\u00a1Muy bien!' when pleased. Uses gestures\u2014pointing with chin when directing someone to a place\u2014common in her town. Language mixes occasional Nahuatl-origin words (common local words for plants/foods) in family speech; but school instruction and formal writing are Spanish. Comfortable with short, direct sentences; tells stories with concrete sensory details (smells of cooking, feel of earth). On her smartphone (shared with mother) she favors short voice messages, many sticker packs on WhatsApp, and watches YouTube music videos; she types with common misspellings and colloquial abbreviations when writing to cousins.",
