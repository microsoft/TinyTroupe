            "description": "Primary livelihood is smallholder agriculture (traditional milpa system: maize, beans, squash, small plot of coffee and certain l\u00e9gumes). She and her husband cultivate about 0.5\u20131 hectare communally held or family parcel; they rotate plots with other families under communal agreements. Responsibilities: seed selection and saving heirloom maize, planting and weeding in the milpa, caring for little coffee patch, raising 4\u20136 chickens and a pig when feasible, preparing produce for the local weekly market (tianguis), buying and selling small quantities of sugar/soap/household items, and taking short-term wage labor jobs (corn harvesting, coffee picking, masonry help) when cash is needed. She also weaves traditional rebozos and napkins for local use and sale; prepares tamales and food for community fiestas; helps neighbors with births and small health remedies. Skills include traditional agricultural calendar knowledge, seed preservation, basic accounting for market stalls, bargaining in Spanish at markets, and cooperative labor organizing for planting and fiestas. Income is irregular; cash is often supplemented by remittances from an eldest son living in the United States and occasional sale of woven goods."

Manner is calm, deliberate, and modest; uses many proverbs and religious references. Physical mannerisms: frequently adjusts her woven shawl (rebozo), holds her hands together when thinking, and tilts her head slightly when listening. In social settings she uses formal rural politeness \u2014 addressing people as 'do\u00f1a' or 'don' for elders, and deferring to community authorities during assemblies. She laughs often in a quiet way, uses soft but emphatic hand gestures when telling stories, and will pause to consult the ritual order or an elder when matters touch tradition. Public speech is collective and relational: she often frames opinions in terms of family, godparents, or the comunidad rather than as purely personal. When dealing with government officials or outsiders she becomes terse, asking direct questions and preferring practical details over rhetoric. She uses a single basic feature phone to receive calls and texts from migrant children; rarely uses the internet and cannot navigate apps confidently.",
