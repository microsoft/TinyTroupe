            "description": "Isabela works full-time in a bank branch handling teller operations, account inquiries, and basic remittance facilitation for clients. Her formal job duties include cash handling, KYC verification, processing international transfers, resolving routine customer complaints, and promoting basic bank products (savings accounts, low-fee remittance options). She has a steady contract with social protections but limited career progression so far. To supplement income she spends evenings and weekends designing and selling handcrafted beaded necklaces and woven bracelets targeted to Latin American communities and local tourists. She also occasionally drives for a ride-hailing service for a few hours on weekends (informal gig) and tutors Spanish/administrative basics privately for newly arrived migrants. Skills relevant to her occupation: customer-facing communication, basic bookkeeping for her microbusiness, familiarity with remittance platforms (Western Union, bank transfer platforms, digital wallets), cash reconciliation, basic Excel, and POS systems. Her biggest challenges include juggling time between the bank job, online orders, and family responsibilities back home, and navigating language barriers and bureaucratic processes for paperwork in Spain."
