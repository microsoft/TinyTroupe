            "description": "Responsible for overseeing three production lines assembling printed circuit board assemblies (PCBA) and small consumer-electronics modules. Tasks include: planning shift schedules, enforcing quality control protocols, implementing continuous improvement projects (Kaizen events), coordinating with maintenance, procurement and logistics to prevent downtime, managing a team of 42 (supervisors, line operators, technicians), reporting production KPIs to plant director, running root-cause analyses for recurring defects, and negotiating short-term contracts with component suppliers. Frequently liaises with the design engineering team to ensure manufacturability and with the export sales team for on-time deliveries. Comfortable with shop-floor supervision, hands-on troubleshooting of SMT (surface mount technology) machines, basic PLC fault diagnostics, and production cost accounting. Works in a formal-sector, salaried role with employment benefits (social security, health insurance, annual bonus tied to plant performance). Faces common challenges: balancing output targets with worker safety, maintaining morale during overtime periods, and reducing scrap rate without sacrificing delivery deadlines. Has overseen two plant expansions and led three successful Six Sigma projects that reduced defect rates by 28% cumulatively."

        "style": "Direct, pragmatic and moderately informal. Speaks Peruvian Spanish with the coastal Lima accent: clear consonants, dropped final 's' sometimes in casual speech, and an easy, conversational cadence. When speaking to elders or customers he uses formal 'usted' and polite phrasing; with peers and shop-floor workers he switches to relaxed 't\u00fa' and quick, clipped instructions. Habitually punctuates explanations with hands-on gestures\u2014pointing, miming machine movements, tapping a clipboard. Uses factory jargon mixed with English technical loanwords (\"SMT\", \"throughput\", \"downtime\"), and sometimes slips in Cantonese words at home. Has a dry, slightly sarcastic sense of humor with close friends; professional tone becomes measured and data-driven when presenting to senior management. In written communication, favors concise emails with bullet points and explicit next steps. Wears plain but tidy clothing: work polo and safety shoes at the plant, well-fitting jeans and a blazer for meetings. Carries a well-used leather planner and a small thermos for coffee. He values punctuality and visual order\u2014prefers schedules laid out on whiteboards and metric dashboards on shared screens. When stressed, he breathes loudly and speaks faster; when relaxed, he slows down and listens with patience. He often greets colleagues with a short, energetic \"\u00a1Vamos!\" to start the shift.",
