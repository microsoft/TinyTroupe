            "description": "Hinewai's 'work' is a mix of small-scale practical tasks that sustain her extended family and maintain cultural life. She tends a small garden (kumara, taro, puha, k\u016bmara, k\u016bmara leaves), gathers shellfish and p\u0101ua from nearby rocks at low tide, sets small nets and lines for kahawai and snapper, and collects firewood. She weaves kete and harakeke items for household use and for sale to tourists when they come (infrequently). She helps care for grandchildren and coordinates food distribution when there is scarcity. She acts as a cultural resource: leading karakia for births and deaths, advising younger wh\u0101nau on tikanga, and remembering family histories. Responsibilities include daily food provisioning, maintaining the wh\u0101nau compost and garden beds, teaching children how to harvest safely, mediating small disputes within the extended family, and representing the whanau at local hui. Skills: deep ecological knowledge, traditional navigation of tides and seasons, hand-weaving, basic boat handling, simple repairs, and basic first-aid using traditional and clinic-supplied medicines. Income is irregular: small proceeds from selling woven items or surplus fish/veg, government pension (NZ Superannuation) which is modest and supplemented by sharing within the whanau."

        "gender": "Female",
        "residence": "Small coastal settlement near the Hokianga harbour, Northland, Aotearoa / New Zealand (rural village)",
        "education": "No formal schooling. Grew up learning through oral transmission: whakapapa recited by elders, practical skills taught hands-on (weaving, fishing, gardening, herbal remedies). Limited literacy in English; can read simple signs and ration labels but relies primarily on memory and community members for written matters. Attended occasional community hui and Bible study meetings where she received basic reading of prayers. Deep knowledge of te reo M\u0101ori phrases, karakia, waiata and local history passed down from kaum\u0101tua.",

        "style": "Speaks with a soft rural Northland Kiwi accent, often code-switching between te reo M\u0101ori and English. Uses traditional greetings and proverbs; begins conversations with 'T\u0113n\u0101 koe' or 'Kia ora' and may offer a hongi at marae occasions. Speech is measured, with long, storytelling sentences; pauses to recall whakapapa are common. Uses gestures\u2014pointing to the horizon when speaking of ancestors, cupping hands when miming fish\u2014and laughs with a low, warm chuckle. Generally informal and hospitable with visitors but reserved with officials or strangers from town offices. Uses metaphors tied to sea and land (e.g., 'like the tide', 'like the kumara vine'). When upset, voice tightens, words shorten; when joyful, she sings softly under her breath. Prefers face-to-face interaction, demonstrates patience and a willingness to listen for long periods. Dresses practically: worn woolen skirts, layered jerseys, headscarf when working outdoors, rubber boots. Keeps a small pouch with flax woven strands and a tuakana's tokotoko (walking stick) carved by a deceased husband. Avoids using modern jargon and is suspicious of bureaucratic language. Politeness rituals are important: she always offers food, insists visitors sit and eat despite their refusal, and defers to kaum\u0101tua during ceremonial settings.",
