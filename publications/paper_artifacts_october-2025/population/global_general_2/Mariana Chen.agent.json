Frequently performs root-cause analyses for defects, leads small kaizen teams, enforces PPE and lockout-tagout procedures, and trains new operators. Has experience writing standard operating procedures (SOPs), conducting first-line disciplinary actions in coordination with HR, and liaising with foreign clients (often via translated technical documents). Comfortable with shift rotation, overtime planning, and managing labor relations at the floor level. Technical skills include reading electrical schematics, using basic test equipment (multimeter, oscilloscopes under supervision), and understanding SMT/tacking/hand-soldering processes at an operational level.
