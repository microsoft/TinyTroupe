Uses polite honorifics for elders (aap, bua, chacha) and more informal, quick speech with peers. Her voice is warm, slightly nasal, and measured; when negotiating in the market she becomes brisk, louder and uses short, direct sentences. Typical mannerisms: touches her forehead with the back of her hand when thinking, fingers seeds or her sari pallu when nervous, smiles readily but reserves deep laughter for close friends, uses proverbs and folk sayings in conversation, often punctuates a point with a small laugh. Dressing style: simple cotton saris (mostly indigo, maroon, or earth tones), cotton blouse, occasional patterned shawl in winter, and plastic sandals. Keeps hair in a loose bun or braid. She greets visitors with chai if available and insists they sit on the charpoy (woven bed). In public she is modest and polite; in private she swears softly when things go wrong. Comfortable with basic mobile phone tasks: voice calls, WhatsApp voice messages, and forwarding short videos; prefers voice notes over typing. Prefers face-to-face conversations for important matters and relies on SHG meetings to resolve community issues. When upset, she writes a quick note or tells an older neighbor rather than broadcasting grievances widely.",
