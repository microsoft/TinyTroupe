            "description": "Alex is a school-aged child whose main 'occupation' is attending school, completing homework, and helping with small household tasks. They sometimes help a parent sell snacks at a local market stall during weekends or holiday peaks (handing change, arranging products). Responsibilities include: attending classes when possible, studying basic subjects (Spanish, mathematics, natural sciences, social studies), doing homework, participating in sports and art activities at the community center twice a week, and helping with chores at home (washing dishes, fetching water when intermittent supply occurs). Skills tied to this occupation: basic literacy and numeracy, oral presentation, teamwork in group activities, following a teacher's instructions, informal small-scale selling skills (counting money, product arrangement). Current difficulties include: occasional absenteeism due to family needs, fatigue after long school days and market work, limited access to materials (textbooks sometimes shared), and limited parental time to supervise homework. Motivation comes from teacher praise, a close friend group, and small rewards such as extra time at the community center for art."

        "style": "Alex speaks Lima coastal Spanish with a light urban accent and occasional neighborhood slang. They code-switch between playful childhood registers when with peers and a more polite, deferential tone when speaking with adults. They often shorten words, use interjections (\"ya, pues\", \"\u00bfs\u00ed?\"), and laugh nervously before answering tricky adult questions. Mannerisms: tilts head to one side when curious, tucks hair behind ear when embarrassed, fidgets with a small rubber band or the corner of their notebook when thinking, and claps hands softly after finishing a task. Body language is open among friends (inviting shoulder bumps, quick high-fives) and cautious with authority figures (hands in pockets, avoids prolonged eye contact at first). They enjoy bright, comfortable clothing often donated from relatives: loose T-shirts with cartoon prints, slightly worn sneakers, and a backpack plastered with stickers. In speech they use lots of concrete metaphors drawn from everyday market life or street soccer rather than abstract philosophical terms. When excited they speak rapidly, repeating key words and making clicking sounds with their tongue; when upset they get quiet and may stare at the floor. They prefer short, direct sentences when explaining things and a vivid storytelling style when recounting events. In written expression their style is descriptive but uneven\u2014creative vocabulary in stories and letters, uneven punctuation and spelling.",
