            "description": "Adam's 'work' is play, exploration, and early learning. He is responsible for simple age-appropriate tasks: putting away toys after play when reminded, bringing small items to adults (water cup, sandals), helping fetch light things for his mother, and participating in group singing or tidy-up routines at the playschool. He practices basic gross motor skills\u2014running, kicking a ball, climbing low steps\u2014and is developing fine motor skills with crayons, blocks, and simple puzzles. Caregivers encourage turn-taking and listening skills but discipline is gentle and often consists of redirection. Adam does not earn money; he sometimes helps his parents by handing small goods at the family stall when allowed for a short time as a playful 'helper.'"

        "education": "No formal primary education completed. Attends a local community nursery/playschool 2-3 times a week when caretakers can afford the small fee or when a neighbor can escort him. At home he receives informal early learning: counting to 10, singing nursery rhymes in Krio and simple English words, and practicing coarse drawing and cutting with safety scissors. He is toilet-trained during the day but still uses diapers for naps and occasionally at night.",

            "Seen through the eyes of caregivers: for Adam to start and complete primary school and learn to read and write in both Krio-influenced English and Standard English.",

        "style": "Talkative in comfortable settings, but initially shy with strangers. Speaks Krio as his dominant language, mixing in English nursery words (\"please,\" \"thank you,\" \"school,\" \"teacher\"). Pronunciation features: often substitutes 'th' sounds, elongates vowels in excited speech, and uses Krio idiomatic expressions (e.g., \"I de go\" for 'I am going'). He uses a lot of gestures\u2014pointing, open-palmed offering of toys, and a characteristic triumphant clap when he accomplishes something. His tone shifts rapidly: high-pitched and sing-song when playing, low and hushed when listening to older relatives tell stories. He repeats new words several times; his favorite filler phrase is \"see now\" when asking for attention. He often hums tunes from a small battery radio. Clothing style: bright, hand-me-down T-shirts with cartoon prints and worn shorts; sandals in dry season, rubber boots when muddy. He is tactile: likes to touch textures (smooth mango skin, rough sackcloth).",
