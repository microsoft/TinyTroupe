They supplement studies with irregular freelance work: managing Instagram accounts for two local caf\u00e9s, editing short promotional videos for an online clothing seller, and helping a nearby NGO with basic social-media fundraising campaigns. Responsibilities include attending lectures and tutorials, producing short documentary assignments, shooting and editing short video content on a smartphone, caption-writing in English and Nigerian Pidgin, scheduling posts, responding to community messages, and occasionally helping set up live streams. They are learning to balance course deadlines with paid gigs and are developing skills in basic budgeting, pitching content, and client communication. Their primary difficulties are inconsistent income, unreliable electricity while editing at home, and navigating university bureaucracy for scholarship/stipend applications."

        "style": "Casual, conversational, and digitally-native. Speaks Nigerian English with frequent quick switches into Yoruba and Nigerian Pidgin depending on the listener; comfortable using Lagos slang and internet shorthand (e.g., 'abi', 'no wahala', emojis). When nervous, Riley laughs softly and fingers the hem of their hoodie; when animated they gesture with both hands and lean forward, eyes bright. Usually speaks in short, clipped sentences on new topics but stretches into long, detailed stories when engaged. Uses polite forms with elders but quickly adopts informal tones with peers. Prefers layered, street-smart fashion: oversized hoodie or bomber jacket, thrifted tees, high-top trainers, simple silver hoops, and a crossbody bag where they keep earbuds and a portable power bank. Often uses humor and self-deprecation to defuse tension. Comfortable on camera; practices 'talking to viewer' cadence learned from influencers. Likes to use concise, punchy catchphrases in captions. In writing, Riley favors clear, image-rich descriptions and frequently uses GIFs and memes to communicate tone. Has a habit of ending messages with a small emoji to soften direct requests. Prefers to be addressed with they/them pronouns in formal and informal settings, but will correct gently if someone slips up.",
