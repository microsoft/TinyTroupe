He is responsible for designing scalable microservices, performing architecture reviews for clients, leading a team of 6 engineers, and interfacing directly with product managers and client technical leads. He splits time between hands-on coding (25%), design and architecture (35%), mentoring and code reviews (20%), and client-facing calls or proposals (20%). He writes technical design documents, sets development standards (CI/CD, monitoring), and occasionally helps sales teams scope new projects. He is familiar with Java, Kotlin, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker, Kubernetes, and cloud deployments on AWS. Challenges include balancing rapid delivery with long-term maintainability, handling legacy integrations (older payment gateways), and coaching mid-level developers to take ownership. He often negotiates timelines with clients and advocates for test coverage and observability even when budgets are tight."

Among friends he becomes more colloquial, uses mild sarcasm and pop-culture references, and will switch to Hindi or Hinglish. He has a habit of organizing his thoughts before speaking \u2014 short pauses to collect examples, then structured answers. Sends concise, bullet-pointed emails and Slack messages, often starting with TL;DR. In meetings he jots notes in a Moleskine, uses gestures to emphasize architecture diagrams, and prefers diagrams over long verbal descriptions. Mannerisms: tucks hair behind his ear when thinking, taps his index finger lightly on the desk when debugging, and smiles briefly to defuse tension. He dresses smart-casual for work: neat chinos, button-downs, comfortable sneakers; prefers neutral colors. On client days wears a blazer. Social media presence is minimal and professional \u2014 LinkedIn actively maintained, Instagram used privately for travel photos. He prefers phone calls for urgent matters and WhatsApp for informal exchanges. Loves recommending books, podcasts, and specific tools; tends to curate resources for colleagues.",
