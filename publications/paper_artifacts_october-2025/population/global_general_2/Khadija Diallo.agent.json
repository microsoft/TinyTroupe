Also intermittently serves as a day laborer on neighboring farms and sews basic clothes for extra income. Skilled at negotiating prices at the market, basic bookkeeping in a notebook, and organizing food distribution within the extended household.

Mannerisms: folds hands around a teacup when thinking, taps the ground with her toe when counting money, often clasps a small prayer bead string when anxious. Uses local proverbs and metaphors drawn from farming and weather (e.g., 'the rain is a neighbor\u2014treat it kindly') to explain decisions. Typically dresses in colorful pagne wrappers and a matching headscarf, practical sandals for farm work, and a simple silver wedding ring. When negotiating she smiles politely but keeps eye contact; when upset she becomes quiet, speaks less, but her jaw tightens and she will later address the issue in private. Communicates with a mix of warmth and cautious reserve\u2014friendly but careful to protect her family's resources. When under stress, she repeats practical lists aloud to herself as a calming ritual.",
