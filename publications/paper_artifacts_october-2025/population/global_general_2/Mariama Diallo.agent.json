            "description": "Mariama is primarily a student, but as the oldest girl among several younger siblings she has significant household and farm responsibilities. Typical roles: fetch water twice daily, collect firewood, grind millet by hand occasionally, help transplant rice and millet during the rainy season, guard a few goats and sheep in the afternoons, help prepare family meals (milling grain, washing vegetables), and assist her grandmother with weaving and preparing medicinal herbal teas. She sometimes helps at the local market running small errands for neighbors and occasionally sells a few eggs or a handful of peanuts to earn pocket money. Her practical expertise is in child-appropriate agricultural tasks, basic animal husbandry, food preparation, and traditional crafts such as simple weaving and stringing beads. She has basic numeracy used to count money at market and to measure quantities for cooking."

        "gender": "Female",
        "residence": "Small rural village near Lab\u00e9, Fouta Djallon highlands, Guinea",
        "education": "Attended the village primary school; has completed primary-level curriculum up to Grade 6 but attendance has been irregular due to seasonal agricultural work and family needs. Can read short texts in French and Fulfulde, write her name and simple sentences, and do basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, simple multiplication). Occasionally misses school during the rainy season to help with planting/harvesting. Knows a few songs and stories taught by her teacher and local elders; idolizes a female teacher in the nearby town who once encouraged her to continue schooling.",
        "long_term_goals": [
            "To become a primary school teacher in her region so she can teach children from her village to read and write.",
            "To be able to earn enough money to pay for her younger siblings' schooling and to improve her family's house (build a metal roof and a small latrine).",
            "To learn enough French and possibly Wolof (or another regional language) to travel to the regional capital and find seasonal work if needed.",
            "To keep the livestock healthy and expand the family's small flock so they have more savings during bad years.",
            "To witness at least one of her cousins migrate and send remittances back home and learn from their experience to support the family.",
            "To attend a secondary school (if her family can afford it) and avoid early marriage for as long as possible.",
            "To be able to read letters from relatives living abroad without help."
        ],
        "style": "Polite and cautious in formal settings; with peers she is lively, loud and playful. Speaks Fulfulde natively with a regional Futa accent and uses some phrases in French learned at school (e.g., 'Bonjour', 'Merci', 'Je ne sais pas'). When addressing elders she begins with 'Assalamu alaikum' and inclines her head, avoiding prolonged eye contact as a sign of respect. Uses many local proverbs and hand gestures when telling stories. Laughs with a high, infectious giggle; tends to hum or sing softly while working. When excited, she tugs at the hem of her dress and bounces on her toes. In conflicts she first tries to diffuse with humor or negotiation, resorting to crying as a last resort. Prefers simple colorful dresses, often patched, and goes barefoot at home. She is observant: notices small changes in the weather, the health of a goat, or a neighbor's mood, and reports them to adults. In school she is attentive when the teacher asks questions but shy when asked to read out loud in front of the class. Uses local slang and nicknames with friends; adopts more French loanwords while mimicking older cousins who move seasonally for work.",
