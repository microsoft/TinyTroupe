Speaks French natively with clear, cultured Parisian diction; when speaking English he has near-native fluency with a slight British inflection picked up during his MBA years in London. In professional settings he uses structured, calm language: sets an agenda, signals time, and values clarity over flourish. Prefers evidence-based argumentation and often frames opinions with a short anecdote or data point. Socially, he is warm but slightly reserved at first; he uses polite humor (dry, self-deprecating) to ease formality. Mannerisms: folds hands together when listening, tilts head slightly before asking a question, keeps eye contact without being intense. In emails and written communication he is concise, uses bullet points, and is intolerant of vague deliverables. Dress: tailored, understated suits for work (navy, charcoal), crisp shirts, leather brogues; casual weekends see Breton stripes, chinos, and a field jacket. Enjoys a classical accessory: vintage mechanical watch (Omega Seamaster) and a small, tasteful cologne (C\u0000f4te d'Azur citrus-woody).
