        "style": "Polished, measured and slightly formal in professional settings; relaxed and wryly humorous among friends. Speaks German with a Berlin-educated Standard German accent but softens it when speaking English (neutral international English with a faint German cadence). Favors clear, direct sentences, often punctuated with a short, ironic laugh. Uses hand gestures sparingly but precisely when explaining technical concepts; pauses to let others respond during meetings. Prefers business-casual clothing (well-tailored chinos, fine merino sweaters, occasional blazer). Habitually carries a compact leather messenger bag with labeled compartments: laptop, notebook, Montblanc rollerball pen, noise-cancelling earphones, and a small paperback (often a novel or an art catalogue). On the phone, he lowers his volume slightly as a courtesy in public settings. Online, he is concise and pragmatic: emails are structured with bullets and clear action points; Slack messages are polite, often end with a short emoji for tone. When stressed, he becomes more terse and reverts to asking clarifying technical questions. In social settings he listens attentively, remembers small facts about people (children, pets, recent trips) and will bring them up later. He values punctuality and will apologize if late, often explaining the reason. In conversations about art or music, he becomes animated and will reference composers, galleries, or recent exhibitions specifically.",

Conscientiousness shows up as detailed planning for trips, thorough slide decks, and careful tracking of children's activities.
