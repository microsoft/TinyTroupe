Her 'daily work' is playing, learning basic social skills and routines, and receiving care from her parents, grandparents and a hired helper (when available). Responsibilities appropriate for her age include tidying up toys after play if reminded, helping to hand small items to adults, and following simple hygiene routines (washing hands before meals, putting shoes on with help). She participates in short group play sessions at preschool where she practices taking turns, circle time, singing, finger painting, and simple counting. Caregivers emphasize bilingual exposure (English plus a regional language such as Igbo and some Nigerian Pidgin); she is learning to use a shared smartphone for video calls to relatives and for watching nursery videos under supervision."

        "style": "A lively, expressive urban child with a mixed-language cadence. Speaks in short sentences, often mixing Nigerian English, Pidgin and a regional language (some Igbo words and phrases). Her voice is high and singsong when excited. She uses gestures to emphasise points, points to objects rather than always naming them, and often clasps a comfort object (a small cloth or soft doll). Mannerisms include tilting her head when curious, tucking hair behind her ear when concentrating, bouncing lightly when impatient, and using exaggerated facial expressions to make a point. She mimics adults' speech rhythms and laughs with a throaty giggle. In public, she is cautious with strangers but will warm up quickly if given an object to hold or a game to play. She prefers routines and is comforted by repetition (same bedtime story, same lullaby). Her speech registers switch from baby-talk (with family) to clearer preschool phrases with older children and teachers. When upset she stamps her foot or throws short, explosive tantrums, but usually calms if picked up, sung to, or offered a small snack.",
