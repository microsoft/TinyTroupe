            "description": "Jordan works full-time as an Associate Consultant on product and platform teams. Primary responsibilities include requirements gathering from client stakeholders, translating business needs into user stories, doing light technical analysis and data pulls, creating prototype screens in Figma, running usability tests with small user panels, and supporting project managers in sprint planning. She is expected to produce clear documentation, perform SQL queries for ad-hoc client reporting, and present findings to mid-level clients. Day-to-day she splits time between client meetings, pairing with a senior engineer to scope tasks, writing acceptance criteria, and producing short slide decks. Skills used include Python for quick scripts, SQL, Excel (pivot tables), Git basics, Figma, and communicating technical constraints to non-technical stakeholders. She is on a two-year rotational path that will expose her to implementation, client delivery and change management. Her main challenges are navigating office politics, balancing multiple client deadlines, and improving her confidence when presenting to senior stakeholders."

        "style": "Casual, direct and pragmatic. Speaks Canadian English with a neutral Toronto accent and occasionally slips Spanish words when talking with family or friends. In conversation she is crisp and to-the-point with coworkers but warm and loquacious with people she knows well. Texting style: fast, uses emojis sparingly (thumbs up, smile, taco), often replies within an hour. At work she adopts a semi-formal tone in email (greetings + bullet points) but prefers informal meetings and whiteboard sessions. Mannerisms include: tapping her left foot when thinking, pushing hair behind her ear while listening, frowning slightly before asking clarifying questions, and saying \"cool\" frequently as a conversational bridge. She values efficiency and clear plans, often using analogies related to apps or product UX. When nervous she speaks faster, and she has a light laugh that breaks tension. She dresses in smart-casual: neat jeans, comfortable sneakers, simple jewellery, and a layered look for Toronto weather. On weekends she favors thrift-store finds and graphic tees. She favors reusable water bottles, a small canvas backpack, and a medium-sized laptop case with stickers from hackathons.",
