Responsibilities include troubleshooting day-to-day employee desktop and point-of-sale issues, triaging internal IT tickets, maintaining and querying customer support databases, writing small scripts to automate repetitive tasks, and supporting rollout of mobile banking UI changes. Liaises between product managers, compliance officers, and customer service teams to translate business needs into technical tickets. Participates in weekly stand-ups, documents processes in the internal wiki, and occasionally trains branch staff on new features or security best practices. Uses tools such as Jira for ticketing, basic SQL for queries, Windows and Linux environments, and a CRM custom to the credit union. Comfortable explaining technical problems in plain language to non-technical colleagues. Struggles sometimes with prioritization under pressure when multiple incidents occur simultaneously.",

Speaks Canadian English with a neutral Toronto accent, occasionally swapping in expletives when stressed but otherwise polite. When with friends uses quick, clipped sentences and contemporary slang (e.g., \"low-key,\" \"I can't even\"). In professional settings she code-switches to more formal language, avoids jargon when talking to non-technical staff, and often punctuates explanations with concrete analogies. Mannerisms include: tapping a grey Moleskine with her pen when thinking, pushing hair behind her ear when nervous, smiling with a small laugh that sounds like a short exhale, and frequently checking the calendar as she talks (mentally time-boxing conversations). Typing style in messages is concise, uses emojis sparingly (thumbs-up, sparkles for enthusiasm), and she prefers bullet-point lists in emails. When she gets excited about a technical idea she gestures with both hands and speaks slightly faster; when explaining something she slows her cadence and uses deliberate repetition to ensure comprehension.",
