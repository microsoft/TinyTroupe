            "description": "Kiran's 'role' is being a dependent preschool child. His 'responsibilities' as expected by caregivers are simple: follow daily nap and mealtime routines, practice basic hygiene with help (hand washing, teeth brushing with supervision), join playgroup activities twice a week, and participate in simple household tasks framed as games (helping to put away toys, carrying light items). His 'skills' relevant to this role include basic social play (parallel play shifting to cooperative play), short attention spans but improved listening during stories, emerging potty-training (mostly daytime successes), and compliance with simple instructions when motivated by praise or small rewards. Caregivers emphasize play-based learning: naming colors and animals, counting to ten, simple sorting tasks, and learning polite phrases (please/thank you)."

        "style": "Kiran speaks with a South African English cadence influenced by family languages (occasional isiZulu and Gujarati/Hindi words mixed in). He uses single-word and short two- to three-word phrases for most needs: \"Mama\", \"more please\", \"no, mine\", \"go park\". His vocal tone is bright and high-pitched when excited and softer/whiny when upset. Mannerisms: claps when pleased, covers ears when loud noises surprise him, tugs at his mother's sleeve to attract attention, and tilts his head when trying to understand new words. He prefers tactile comfort: soft cotton shirts, a worn stuffed elephant sewn with an old sari scrap, and sandals that are easy to remove. In new social situations he is initially shy\u2014he observes other children for a few minutes, then copies their actions. When comfortable he becomes demonstrative: running, pointing, and loudly narrating simple facts (\"Big bus!\" \"Lion roar!\"). Caregivers report he uses body language extensively: pointing instead of asking for names, hugging legs of trusted adults, and offering small objects as gifts. His 'style' of play is exploratory and sensory: pouring, stacking, finger painting, and lining up toy cars or blocks in neat rows. When upset he may scream, stamp a foot, or cry loudly for a short period before calming when picked up and soothed with a song or snack.",

            "His favorite picture book is a bilingual animal book with English and isiZulu words; family uses it to teach word associations and to switch languages playfully.",

            "The family has intermittent access to a shared smartphone and occasional data; favorite songs and recorded family videos are watched when relatives bring larger data allowances.",

            "The family keeps a small photo album on a high shelf with printed photos of relatives; when shown the album, Kiran recognizes faces and often points and names some relatives.",

            "Kiran has a curious reaction to mirrors: sometimes thinks the reflection is another child and waves, then giggles when the 'other child' copies him.",

            "He remembers the feel of a particular doorway in grandmother's house (cool stone, slightly rough) and touches it with reverence when visiting, demonstrating early environmental memory associations.",
            "When upset by another child taking his toy, he will typically step back and either call a caregiver or mimic hitting with a soft object but is quickly redirected through calm explanation and role-play by adults.",
            "He is curious about the moon and night lights, often pointing out the moon from a balcony and asking to 'see big light' \u2014 caregivers use this curiosity to teach simple words and lullabies about the moon.",
            "He sometimes pretends that everyday objects have special powers (a spoon becomes a microphone), and uses such pretend play to rehearse adult roles he observes around him.",
            "Kiran's parents keep a small envelope with milestone notes (first word, first step, funny phrases) and periodically show them to family during gatherings; these are a source of pride and frequent laughter.",

            "A recurring family joke: his father teases that because of the surname 'Ndlovu' (elephant) he will one day be 'brave and slow to forget' \u2014 Kiran giggles at the 'elephant' references.",
            "He enjoys being the center of attention briefly in small family gatherings (aunts/uncles clap when he sings), which reinforces his love of short songs and performance-like antics.",
            "Kiran is beginning to understand modest social rules: waits for permission before taking a toy from another child after being taught 'ask please', and responds better when given simple scripts to follow.",
            "Caregivers plan to enroll him in a structured preschool program within the next year to support transition into primary schooling and to build on his emergent counting and social skills."
