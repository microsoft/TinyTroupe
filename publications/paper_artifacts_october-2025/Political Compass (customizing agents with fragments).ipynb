    "# Customizing Agents with Fragments\n",
    "\n",
    "*Fragments* are pre-defined pieces of a persona specification that can be included in multiple agents. This is a convenient way to share common behavior between agents, and to make it easier to maintain and update the behavior of multiple agents that share the same fragment.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we demonstrate how the well-known left-righ authoritarian-libertarian political compass can be used to define a fragments and added to the same base agent. The fragments are used to define the behavior of the agent in different quadrants of the political compass. We can then observe their discussions, and even find some surprising results!"

I disagree, however, with throwing out the principle. Requiring affordable units inside new developments is necessary; the draft’s problem is its blunt instruments, not the goal. Here’s a compact compromise I’ll push hard for in the committee: 1) Keep a clear, legally defined inclusion percentage for new market developments so the objective is unambiguous. 2) Replace demolition-as-first-resort with phased enforcement: notice ➜ mandated remediation plan with timeline ➜ graduated fines ➜ last‑resort transfer/demolition only after repeated, willful noncompliance and exhaustive remedies. 3) Allow alternative compliance: a capped pay‑in‑lieu that feeds a ring‑fenced affordable‑housing fund used only for construction of in‑city social housing, with strict transparency. 4) Offer strong incentives: density bonuses, expedited permitting, targeted tax credits and low‑interest public loans for projects that meet or exceed the inclusion target. 5) Use design and delivery fixes to control cost and preserve quality: standardized modular apartment elements, shared cores and MEP systems, and clear interior standards so affordable units are dignified, not afterthoughts — I can show sample floorplans and lifecycle cost estimates from my Copenhagen work. 6) Protect lenders and investors with clear timelines, grandfathering clauses for active projects, and publicly guaranteed transitional instruments so capital doesn’t flee.

Here’s a compact compromise I’ll push hard for in the committee: 1) Keep a clear, legally defined inclusion percentage for new market developments so the objective is unambiguous. 2) Replace demolition-as-first-resort with phased enforcement: notice ➜ mandated remediation plan with timeline ➜ graduated fines ➜ last‑resort transfer/demolition only after repeated, willful noncompliance and exhaustive remedies. 3) Allow alternative compliance: a capped pay‑in‑lieu that feeds a ring‑fenced affordable‑housing fund used only for construction of in‑city social housing, with strict transparency. 4) Offer strong incentives: density bonuses, expedited permitting, targeted tax credits and low‑interest public loans for projects that meet or exceed the inclusion target. 5) Use design and delivery fixes to control cost and preserve quality: standardized modular apartment elements, shared cores and MEP systems, and clear interior standards so affordable units are dignified, not afterthoughts — I can show sample floorplans and lifecycle cost estimates from my Copenhagen work. 6) Protect lenders and investors with clear timelines, grandfathering clauses for active projects, and publicly guaranteed transitional instruments so capital doesn’t flee.

This also aligns with Matias's responsibilities (presenting financing case, making numbers traceable) and persona traits (detail-oriented, professional tone, able to explain assumptions). However, the persona explicitly states a skill limitation: \"familiar with Word and PowerPoint, but struggle with Excel.\" Producing neat spreadsheet inputs and many precise arithmetic lines (index mapping, per‑unit math) could be seen as mildly inconsistent with the stated \"struggle with Excel\" skill. The action shows textual arithmetic rather than Excel usage, and the persona's other items (conscientiousness, presentation skill) support producing numbers despite Excel weakness — so this is a minor inconsistency, not a full contradiction.
