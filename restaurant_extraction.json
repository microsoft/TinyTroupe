                "ad_copy": "The Mediterranean vegan restaurant concept is innovative and delicious, attracting vegans and those seeking clean eating. High-quality, locally sourced ingredients and reasonable portions are key. The fusion of Mediterranean and vegan cuisines is seen as innovative but potentially restrictive if not well-planned. Addressing seasonal challenges by adapting dishes and focusing on food preservation is crucial. A culinary advisory committee with Mediterranean food, nutrition, and food tech expertise can help with menu development. Ideal locations are Plateau Mont-Royal and Mile End due to high foot traffic and demographics of young professionals, students, and environmentally conscious residents. Zoning bylaws and noise regulations need consideration. Menu adaptations based on local taste preferences can boost performance, especially appealing to international populations. Menu suggestions include mezze options like Mediterranean falafel and vegan dolmades, vegetable skewers, and hearty vegetable and legume stews. Preservation methods using olive oil are recommended. Early feedback can be gathered through vegan/vegetarian community groups and social media surveys. Balancing community insights with expert opinions is important. Testing menu success involves a pilot phase with culinary experts, community groups, and staff for dietary/regulation tests. Facebook ads can be used for initial concept testing based on diet and user demographics."
