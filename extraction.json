Personally, I'm not sure I'd pay a dollar for a song in a restaurant. It depends on the song and the situation. If I was out celebrating with friends and a song we all loved came on the app, maybe I'd chip in. But on a regular Tuesday night? Probably not. As for the curator, I think that *could* be cool, as long as they have decent taste, otherwise I'd just be frustrated."
