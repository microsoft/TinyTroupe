Spontaneity is key, but curation is a caveat. Curated playlists should adapt to the vibe, not try to change it. It should amplify feelings and create a musical hivemind. Legal and ethical clarity, meetings, and revenue benefits are needed. Data privacy and security are crucial. Security measures should avoid cybercrime and hack attacks. Transparency about data collection and use builds trust. Implement additional security for venues and determine ethical values and regulatory things related to MusicCALL."

Curation is caveated at places where one can take lots of spontaneous actions. The curation process is similar to what a DJ does. Following the momentum set by the crowd is critical. Curated playlists should match the vibe. MusicALL can amplify feelings and create a social cohesion. Legal and ethical things need clarity, meetings, and revenue benefits.
