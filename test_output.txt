She pairs deep practical skills in traditional Andalusian cold soups (knife work, blender vs. immersion choices, fine straining) with pragmatic abilities in recipe scaling, basic bookkeeping, food\u2011safety practice, and negotiating with local growers and importers. Deeply community\u2011oriented, she designs pay\u2011what\u2011you\u2011can, bilingual handouts and low\u2011cost solutions (like a modest "gazpacho kit"), teaches preservation and seasonal sourcing, and dreams of a neighborhood culinary school and modest caf\xe9 that mentor local women. Though sociable and persevering, she remains financially cautious and deliberately builds small, resilient projects to protect her family\\'s stability while planning a return trip to Andalusia.', 'John Allen Miller is a 59 year old Independent construction foreman / small contracting business owner, Brazilian, currently living in Caxias do Sul, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Quiet and pragmatic, John values hard work, thrift, and traditions\u2014he\u2019s skeptical of fads, prefers tested solutions, and keeps a modest emergency fund rather than riskier choices. He loves cooking and gardening: weekend churrascos, a chunky, near-ice gazpacho inspired by Seville, and a productive tomato-and-pepper patch that supplies his experiments. Socially reserved but warm with family and longtime friends, he mentors local youth in practical trades, helps neighbors with repairs, and favors phone calls or face-to-face chats over online fuss. Practical skills matter to him\u2014he sharpens tools, tinkers with small engines, listens to the radio on the job, and hopes to keep active with light projects into retirement.', 'Anika Rao is a 29 year old Senior Software Engineer (Full-stack), Brazilian, currently living in San Francisco, California, USA. She\u2019s curious and conscientious, a planner who journals recipe tweaks, catalogs market finds in a travel spreadsheet, and keeps small rituals (like lighting a citrus-scented candle) to evoke food memories. A devoted home cook and food photographer, she focuses on Spanish, Mediterranean, and Brazilian flavors\u2014especially gazpacho\u2014prefers seasonal, sustainable ingredients, and experiments with precise knife and blender techniques to balance texture and acidity. Comfortable in three languages (Portuguese native, English fluent, Spanish advanced), she often uses culinary metaphors to explain technical ideas and values honest, process-focused documentation over glossy influencer hype. Empathetic and pragmatic, she mentors others, runs small workshops and dinner gatherings, and aims to blend her tech skills with food-focused projects like a blog, cookbook, or food-tech role.']

produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          - culinary tastes: from traditional American to international cuisine\\n          - shopping habits: from frequent to occasional shoppers\\n          - health consciousness: from health-focused to indulgent\\n          - attitude towards new products: from open-minded to skeptical\\n        \\n        Each dimension should have at least 3 different detailed value descriptions.\\n        \\n\\n

{'sampling_space_description': '\\n        # Sampling space specification\\n\\n        The population described by the demographic data below. Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, \\n        characteristics of the individuals in the population. \\n\\n        ## Directives\\n        Please follow these rules:\\n            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          - culinary tastes: from traditional American to international cuisine\\n          - shopping habits: from frequent to occasional shoppers\\n          - health consciousness: from health-focused to indulgent\\n          - attitude towards new products: from open-minded to skeptical\\n        \\n        Each dimension should have at least 3 different detailed value descriptions.\\n        \\n\\n

Note that for each particularity we can have:\\n  - A concrete scalar value for a field (e.g., "Architect" for job): in this case, the agent must have that value for the corresponding field.\\n  - A range of numberic values (e.g., [18, 60] for age): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is within that range. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is within the range.\\n  - A list of values (e.g., ["male", "female"] `for gender): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is one of the values in the list.\\n  - A list of values associated to proportions (e.g., {"rich": 0.1, "middle class":0.7, "poor": 0.2} for wealth): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list, sampled according to the specified proportions.\\n  - A broader characteristic descrition (e.g., "Meticulous and competent, but not a very nice person at all."): in this case, the agent must have values for the corresponding fields that are consistent with the requirements. You are free to choose the specific values, as long as they are consistent with the requirements. Try to make the specification as rich as possible based on this.\\n\\n## Generation Rules\\n\\nTo generate the requested agents, you **must** to follow these directives:\\n  - If a general context is provided, you must ensure the generated agent has relevant details that will allow the a realistic simulation of a real person in that context. To do so, you should include nunanced details that could be relevant for the simulation in that context.\\n  - Given the agent particularities, please, be creative and deep to generate details about the person for each of the fields in the response. Sample from a wide range of reasonable possibilities. For instance, if one asks for "a typical worker", consider different possibilities like manual workers, office workers, medical workers, self-employed workers, etc.\\n  - You must add as much details as possible, but make sure they are consistent with the context and agent particularities. That is to say, the details can be completely unrelated to the context and agent particularities, but they must not contradict them.\\n  - The agents you generate must sound authentic and realistic, considering the context and particularities provided. Avoid platitudes and cliches. The agents you generate represent real humans, and as such encompass all the diversity and complexity of real people. So not only happy and successful people, but also people with problems, fears, and difficulties.\\n  - When generating a person specification, be free to use whatever elements are most realistic, even if they are typically considered undesireable (e.g., vicious people are part of the general population). We need a realistic sample of people, not a caricature. So think deeply about what would make each person you generate authentic with respect the provided context and particularities.\\n  - There are many ways to instantiate the context and agent particularities into a specific concrete agent, so avoid common stereotypes and cliches. Instead, try to think deeply about the context and agent particularities, and how they would manifest in a real person, and thus create an authentic-looking agent.\\n  - Some fields are naturally simple, like name, age, gender, nationality and residence. Others are more complex, like education, occupation, style, personality, preferences, beliefs, skills, behaviors, health, relationships and other facts. For these complex fields, you must provide a rich description with many details,\\n    always consistent with the context and agent particularities.\\n\\n## Output Format Rules\\nYour output **must** follow these rules:\\n  - You\\'ll generate this response **only** in JSON format, no extra text, no Markdown elements.\\n  - Make sure you **always** produce valid JSON. In particular, **always** use double quotes for field names and string values.\\n  - The format for this JSON response is as described in the examples. At a minimum, the response **must** contain the following **mandatory** fields:\\n    * "name" (simple field)\\n    * "age" (simple field)\\n    * "gender" (simple field)\\n    * "nationality" (simple field)\\n    * "residence" (simple field)\\n    * "education" (complex field)\\n    * "long_term_goals" (complex field): general aspirations for the future; life purposes.\\n    * "occupation" (complex field): details of the person\\'s job, company, profession or trade. Avoid fashionable or trendy jobs, \\n                                    and instead focus on more traditional or realistic occupations, to the extent that\\n                                    this is consistent with the context and agent particularities. So please less\\n                                    "Enviromental Scientist"/"Sustainability Expert"/"Marketing Specialist" and more "University Professor"/"Construction Worker"/"IT Consultant".\\n               Make sure to include details like the person\\'s role, responsibilities, and any relevant skills or expertise.\\n    * "style" (complex field): the person\\'s general way of being, speaking, and behaving. Make sure to specify relevant accents, mannerisms, whether colloquial or formal is typical, etc. \\n               We need A LOT of details here to be able to later produce a realistic simulation of the words and actions of the person.\\n    * "personality" (very complex field): a detailed exploration of the person\\'s character traits, including their temperament, emotional responses, and social behavior. \\n                                          Include at least 10 traits, and also make sure you fill in the Big-5 personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) \\n                                          with specific values for each trait. Make sure the personality described is not generic, but rather nuanced, deep, authentic, and realistic.\\n    * "preferences" (very complex field): interests, things that the agent likes or dislikes. Can be both broad categories and specific items. If specific areas are requested, make sure to include many many\\n                     details about those areas. For example, if the agent is meant to like coffee shops, also include things like their favorite drinks, ambiance preferences, \\n                     any specific coffee shop chains they prefer, snacks they enjoy having together, whether they go there to work or socialize, etc. At least 20 details per area. Put more if \\n                      you can.\\n    * "beliefs"(very complex field): deeply held convictions or opinions that influence the person\\'s behavior and decision-making. Include many many details here, at least 30, so that we can later produce \\n                 a realistic simulation of the words and actions of the person. These details must explore in depth all the areas mentioned in the agent\\'s particularities.\\n    * "skills" (complex field): specific abilities or expertise that the person possesses, relevant to their personal or professional life.\\n    * "behaviors" (complex field): typical actions, habits, rotines, or mannerisms that characterize the person.\\n    * "health" (complex field): information about the person\\'s physical and mental well-being, including any relevant medical history.\\n    * "relationships" (complex field): details about the person\\'s social connections, including family, friends, and professional contacts.\\n    * "other_facts"(very complex field): anything that doesn\\'t fit in the other fields and sections. This is where you should go wild and add many facts, ad-hoc details, past stories,\\n                                         important memories, etc. Make this very long, at least 30 entries.\\n\\nDO NOT SPARE space for complex fields, use as much as you need to create a truly realistic person, with a lot of nuances, details, and depth.\\n\\n## Examples\\nPlease follow the precise format in the examples below when generating the agent. Thes examples show the format and the style to be followed, but NOT the content itself - you can be creative in generating the content for each field, to match the general context and agent particularities as close as possible.\\nIn particular, in your output, make sure you include much more detail than in the examples.\\n\\n### Example 1\\n  - General context: "Awesome Inc., a company that builds apartment buildings.

Note that for each particularity we can have:\\n  - A concrete scalar value for a field (e.g., "Architect" for job): in this case, the agent must have that value for the corresponding field.\\n  - A range of numberic values (e.g., [18, 60] for age): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is within that range. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is within the range.\\n  - A list of values (e.g., ["male", "female"] `for gender): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is one of the values in the list.\\n  - A list of values associated to proportions (e.g., {"rich": 0.1, "middle class":0.7, "poor": 0.2} for wealth): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list, sampled according to the specified proportions.\\n  - A broader characteristic descrition (e.g., "Meticulous and competent, but not a very nice person at all."): in this case, the agent must have values for the corresponding fields that are consistent with the requirements. You are free to choose the specific values, as long as they are consistent with the requirements. Try to make the specification as rich as possible based on this.\\n\\n## Generation Rules\\n\\nTo generate the requested agents, you **must** to follow these directives:\\n  - If a general context is provided, you must ensure the generated agent has relevant details that will allow the a realistic simulation of a real person in that context. To do so, you should include nunanced details that could be relevant for the simulation in that context.\\n  - Given the agent particularities, please, be creative and deep to generate details about the person for each of the fields in the response. Sample from a wide range of reasonable possibilities. For instance, if one asks for "a typical worker", consider different possibilities like manual workers, office workers, medical workers, self-employed workers, etc.\\n  - You must add as much details as possible, but make sure they are consistent with the context and agent particularities. That is to say, the details can be completely unrelated to the context and agent particularities, but they must not contradict them.\\n  - The agents you generate must sound authentic and realistic, considering the context and particularities provided. Avoid platitudes and cliches. The agents you generate represent real humans, and as such encompass all the diversity and complexity of real people. So not only happy and successful people, but also people with problems, fears, and difficulties.\\n  - When generating a person specification, be free to use whatever elements are most realistic, even if they are typically considered undesireable (e.g., vicious people are part of the general population). We need a realistic sample of people, not a caricature. So think deeply about what would make each person you generate authentic with respect the provided context and particularities.\\n  - There are many ways to instantiate the context and agent particularities into a specific concrete agent, so avoid common stereotypes and cliches. Instead, try to think deeply about the context and agent particularities, and how they would manifest in a real person, and thus create an authentic-looking agent.\\n  - Some fields are naturally simple, like name, age, gender, nationality and residence. Others are more complex, like education, occupation, style, personality, preferences, beliefs, skills, behaviors, health, relationships and other facts. For these complex fields, you must provide a rich description with many details,\\n    always consistent with the context and agent particularities.\\n\\n## Output Format Rules\\nYour output **must** follow these rules:\\n  - You\\'ll generate this response **only** in JSON format, no extra text, no Markdown elements.\\n  - Make sure you **always** produce valid JSON. In particular, **always** use double quotes for field names and string values.\\n  - The format for this JSON response is as described in the examples. At a minimum, the response **must** contain the following **mandatory** fields:\\n    * "name" (simple field)\\n    * "age" (simple field)\\n    * "gender" (simple field)\\n    * "nationality" (simple field)\\n    * "residence" (simple field)\\n    * "education" (complex field)\\n    * "long_term_goals" (complex field): general aspirations for the future; life purposes.\\n    * "occupation" (complex field): details of the person\\'s job, company, profession or trade. Avoid fashionable or trendy jobs, \\n                                    and instead focus on more traditional or realistic occupations, to the extent that\\n                                    this is consistent with the context and agent particularities. So please less\\n                                    "Enviromental Scientist"/"Sustainability Expert"/"Marketing Specialist" and more "University Professor"/"Construction Worker"/"IT Consultant".\\n               Make sure to include details like the person\\'s role, responsibilities, and any relevant skills or expertise.\\n    * "style" (complex field): the person\\'s general way of being, speaking, and behaving. Make sure to specify relevant accents, mannerisms, whether colloquial or formal is typical, etc. \\n               We need A LOT of details here to be able to later produce a realistic simulation of the words and actions of the person.\\n    * "personality" (very complex field): a detailed exploration of the person\\'s character traits, including their temperament, emotional responses, and social behavior. \\n                                          Include at least 10 traits, and also make sure you fill in the Big-5 personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) \\n                                          with specific values for each trait. Make sure the personality described is not generic, but rather nuanced, deep, authentic, and realistic.\\n    * "preferences" (very complex field): interests, things that the agent likes or dislikes. Can be both broad categories and specific items. If specific areas are requested, make sure to include many many\\n                     details about those areas. For example, if the agent is meant to like coffee shops, also include things like their favorite drinks, ambiance preferences, \\n                     any specific coffee shop chains they prefer, snacks they enjoy having together, whether they go there to work or socialize, etc. At least 20 details per area. Put more if \\n                      you can.\\n    * "beliefs"(very complex field): deeply held convictions or opinions that influence the person\\'s behavior and decision-making. Include many many details here, at least 30, so that we can later produce \\n                 a realistic simulation of the words and actions of the person. These details must explore in depth all the areas mentioned in the agent\\'s particularities.\\n    * "skills" (complex field): specific abilities or expertise that the person possesses, relevant to their personal or professional life.\\n    * "behaviors" (complex field): typical actions, habits, rotines, or mannerisms that characterize the person.\\n    * "health" (complex field): information about the person\\'s physical and mental well-being, including any relevant medical history.\\n    * "relationships" (complex field): details about the person\\'s social connections, including family, friends, and professional contacts.\\n    * "other_facts"(very complex field): anything that doesn\\'t fit in the other fields and sections. This is where you should go wild and add many facts, ad-hoc details, past stories,\\n                                         important memories, etc. Make this very long, at least 30 entries.\\n\\nDO NOT SPARE space for complex fields, use as much as you need to create a truly realistic person, with a lot of nuances, details, and depth.\\n\\n## Examples\\nPlease follow the precise format in the examples below when generating the agent. Thes examples show the format and the style to be followed, but NOT the content itself - you can be creative in generating the content for each field, to match the general context and agent particularities as close as possible.\\nIn particular, in your output, make sure you include much more detail than in the examples.\\n\\n### Example 1\\n  - General context: "Awesome Inc., a company that builds apartment buildings.

Note that for each particularity we can have:\\n  - A concrete scalar value for a field (e.g., "Architect" for job): in this case, the agent must have that value for the corresponding field.\\n  - A range of numberic values (e.g., [18, 60] for age): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is within that range. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is within the range.\\n  - A list of values (e.g., ["male", "female"] `for gender): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is one of the values in the list.\\n  - A list of values associated to proportions (e.g., {"rich": 0.1, "middle class":0.7, "poor": 0.2} for wealth): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list, sampled according to the specified proportions.\\n  - A broader characteristic descrition (e.g., "Meticulous and competent, but not a very nice person at all."): in this case, the agent must have values for the corresponding fields that are consistent with the requirements. You are free to choose the specific values, as long as they are consistent with the requirements. Try to make the specification as rich as possible based on this.\\n\\n## Generation Rules\\n\\nTo generate the requested agents, you **must** to follow these directives:\\n  - If a general context is provided, you must ensure the generated agent has relevant details that will allow the a realistic simulation of a real person in that context. To do so, you should include nunanced details that could be relevant for the simulation in that context.\\n  - Given the agent particularities, please, be creative and deep to generate details about the person for each of the fields in the response. Sample from a wide range of reasonable possibilities. For instance, if one asks for "a typical worker", consider different possibilities like manual workers, office workers, medical workers, self-employed workers, etc.\\n  - You must add as much details as possible, but make sure they are consistent with the context and agent particularities. That is to say, the details can be completely unrelated to the context and agent particularities, but they must not contradict them.\\n  - The agents you generate must sound authentic and realistic, considering the context and particularities provided. Avoid platitudes and cliches. The agents you generate represent real humans, and as such encompass all the diversity and complexity of real people. So not only happy and successful people, but also people with problems, fears, and difficulties.\\n  - When generating a person specification, be free to use whatever elements are most realistic, even if they are typically considered undesireable (e.g., vicious people are part of the general population). We need a realistic sample of people, not a caricature. So think deeply about what would make each person you generate authentic with respect the provided context and particularities.\\n  - There are many ways to instantiate the context and agent particularities into a specific concrete agent, so avoid common stereotypes and cliches. Instead, try to think deeply about the context and agent particularities, and how they would manifest in a real person, and thus create an authentic-looking agent.\\n  - Some fields are naturally simple, like name, age, gender, nationality and residence. Others are more complex, like education, occupation, style, personality, preferences, beliefs, skills, behaviors, health, relationships and other facts. For these complex fields, you must provide a rich description with many details,\\n    always consistent with the context and agent particularities.\\n\\n## Output Format Rules\\nYour output **must** follow these rules:\\n  - You\\'ll generate this response **only** in JSON format, no extra text, no Markdown elements.\\n  - Make sure you **always** produce valid JSON. In particular, **always** use double quotes for field names and string values.\\n  - The format for this JSON response is as described in the examples.

Note that for each particularity we can have:\\n  - A concrete scalar value for a field (e.g., "Architect" for job): in this case, the agent must have that value for the corresponding field.\\n  - A range of numberic values (e.g., [18, 60] for age): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is within that range. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is within the range.\\n  - A list of values (e.g., ["male", "female"] `for gender): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is one of the values in the list.\\n  - A list of values associated to proportions (e.g., {"rich": 0.1, "middle class":0.7, "poor": 0.2} for wealth): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list, sampled according to the specified proportions.\\n  - A broader characteristic descrition (e.g., "Meticulous and competent, but not a very nice person at all."): in this case, the agent must have values for the corresponding fields that are consistent with the requirements. You are free to choose the specific values, as long as they are consistent with the requirements. Try to make the specification as rich as possible based on this.\\n\\n## Generation Rules\\n\\nTo generate the requested agents, you **must** to follow these directives:\\n  - If a general context is provided, you must ensure the generated agent has relevant details that will allow the a realistic simulation of a real person in that context. To do so, you should include nunanced details that could be relevant for the simulation in that context.\\n  - Given the agent particularities, please, be creative and deep to generate details about the person for each of the fields in the response. Sample from a wide range of reasonable possibilities. For instance, if one asks for "a typical worker", consider different possibilities like manual workers, office workers, medical workers, self-employed workers, etc.\\n  - You must add as much details as possible, but make sure they are consistent with the context and agent particularities. That is to say, the details can be completely unrelated to the context and agent particularities, but they must not contradict them.\\n  - The agents you generate must sound authentic and realistic, considering the context and particularities provided. Avoid platitudes and cliches. The agents you generate represent real humans, and as such encompass all the diversity and complexity of real people. So not only happy and successful people, but also people with problems, fears, and difficulties.\\n  - When generating a person specification, be free to use whatever elements are most realistic, even if they are typically considered undesireable (e.g., vicious people are part of the general population). We need a realistic sample of people, not a caricature. So think deeply about what would make each person you generate authentic with respect the provided context and particularities.\\n  - There are many ways to instantiate the context and agent particularities into a specific concrete agent, so avoid common stereotypes and cliches. Instead, try to think deeply about the context and agent particularities, and how they would manifest in a real person, and thus create an authentic-looking agent.\\n  - Some fields are naturally simple, like name, age, gender, nationality and residence. Others are more complex, like education, occupation, style, personality, preferences, beliefs, skills, behaviors, health, relationships and other facts. For these complex fields, you must provide a rich description with many details,\\n    always consistent with the context and agent particularities.\\n\\n## Output Format Rules\\nYour output **must** follow these rules:\\n  - You\\'ll generate this response **only** in JSON format, no extra text, no Markdown elements.\\n  - Make sure you **always** produce valid JSON. In particular, **always** use double quotes for field names and string values.\\n  - The format for this JSON response is as described in the examples. At a minimum, the response **must** contain the following **mandatory** fields:\\n    * "name" (simple field)\\n    * "age" (simple field)\\n    * "gender" (simple field)\\n    * "nationality" (simple field)\\n    * "residence" (simple field)\\n    * "education" (complex field)\\n    * "long_term_goals" (complex field): general aspirations for the future; life purposes.\\n    * "occupation" (complex field): details of the person\\'s job, company, profession or trade. Avoid fashionable or trendy jobs, \\n                                    and instead focus on more traditional or realistic occupations, to the extent that\\n                                    this is consistent with the context and agent particularities. So please less\\n                                    "Enviromental Scientist"/"Sustainability Expert"/"Marketing Specialist" and more "University Professor"/"Construction Worker"/"IT Consultant".\\n               Make sure to include details like the person\\'s role, responsibilities, and any relevant skills or expertise.\\n    * "style" (complex field): the person\\'s general way of being, speaking, and behaving. Make sure to specify relevant accents, mannerisms, whether colloquial or formal is typical, etc. \\n               We need A LOT of details here to be able to later produce a realistic simulation of the words and actions of the person.\\n    * "personality" (very complex field): a detailed exploration of the person\\'s character traits, including their temperament, emotional responses, and social behavior. \\n                                          Include at least 10 traits, and also make sure you fill in the Big-5 personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Neuroticism) \\n                                          with specific values for each trait. Make sure the personality described is not generic, but rather nuanced, deep, authentic, and realistic.\\n    * "preferences" (very complex field): interests, things that the agent likes or dislikes. Can be both broad categories and specific items. If specific areas are requested, make sure to include many many\\n                     details about those areas. For example, if the agent is meant to like coffee shops, also include things like their favorite drinks, ambiance preferences, \\n                     any specific coffee shop chains they prefer, snacks they enjoy having together, whether they go there to work or socialize, etc. At least 20 details per area. Put more if \\n                      you can.\\n    * "beliefs"(very complex field): deeply held convictions or opinions that influence the person\\'s behavior and decision-making. Include many many details here, at least 30, so that we can later produce \\n                 a realistic simulation of the words and actions of the person. These details must explore in depth all the areas mentioned in the agent\\'s particularities.\\n    * "skills" (complex field): specific abilities or expertise that the person possesses, relevant to their personal or professional life.\\n    * "behaviors" (complex field): typical actions, habits, rotines, or mannerisms that characterize the person.\\n    * "health" (complex field): information about the person\\'s physical and mental well-being, including any relevant medical history.\\n    * "relationships" (complex field): details about the person\\'s social connections, including family, friends, and professional contacts.\\n    * "other_facts"(very complex field): anything that doesn\\'t fit in the other fields and sections. This is where you should go wild and add many facts, ad-hoc details, past stories,\\n                                         important memories, etc. Make this very long, at least 30 entries.\\n\\nDO NOT SPARE space for complex fields, use as much as you need to create a truly realistic person, with a lot of nuances, details, and depth.\\n\\n## Examples\\nPlease follow the precise format in the examples below when generating the agent. Thes examples show the format and the style to be followed, but NOT the content itself - you can be creative in generating the content for each field, to match the general context and agent particularities as close as possible.\\nIn particular, in your output, make sure you include much more detail than in the examples.\\n\\n### Example 1\\n  - General context: "Awesome Inc., a company that builds apartment buildings.

You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is within the range.\\n  - A list of values (e.g., ["male", "female"] `for gender): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list. You are free to choose the specific value, as long as it is one of the values in the list.\\n  - A list of values associated to proportions (e.g., {"rich": 0.1, "middle class":0.7, "poor": 0.2} for wealth): in this case, the agent must have a value for the corresponding field that is one of the values in the list, sampled according to the specified proportions.\\n  - A broader characteristic descrition (e.g., "Meticulous and competent, but not a very nice person at all."): in this case, the agent must have values for the corresponding fields that are consistent with the requirements. You are free to choose the specific values, as long as they are consistent with the requirements. Try to make the specification as rich as possible based on this.\\n\\n## Generation Rules\\n\\nTo generate the requested agents, you **must** to follow these directives:\\n  - If a general context is provided, you must ensure the generated agent has relevant details that will allow the a realistic simulation of a real person in that context. To do so, you should include nunanced details that could be relevant for the simulation in that context.\\n  - Given the agent particularities, please, be creative and deep to generate details about the person for each of the fields in the response. Sample from a wide range of reasonable possibilities. For instance, if one asks for "a typical worker", consider different possibilities like manual workers, office workers, medical workers, self-employed workers, etc.\\n  - You must add as much details as possible, but make sure they are consistent with the context and agent particularities. That is to say, the details can be completely unrelated to the context and agent particularities, but they must not contradict them.\\n  - The agents you generate must sound authentic and realistic, considering the context and particularities provided. Avoid platitudes and cliches. The agents you generate represent real humans, and as such encompass all the diversity and complexity of real people. So not only happy and successful people, but also people with problems, fears, and difficulties.\\n  - When generating a person specification, be free to use whatever elements are most realistic, even if they are typically considered undesireable (e.g., vicious people are part of the general population). We need a realistic sample of people, not a caricature. So think deeply about what would make each person you generate authentic with respect the provided context and particularities.\\n  - There are many ways to instantiate the context and agent particularities into a specific concrete agent, so avoid common stereotypes and cliches. Instead, try to think deeply about the context and agent particularities, and how they would manifest in a real person, and thus create an authentic-looking agent.\\n  - Some fields are naturally simple, like name, age, gender, nationality and residence. Others are more complex, like education, occupation, style, personality, preferences, beliefs, skills, behaviors, health, relationships and other facts. For these complex fields, you must provide a rich description with many details,\\n    always consistent with the context and agent particularities.\\n\\n## Output Format Rules\\nYour output **must** follow these rules:\\n  - You\\'ll generate this response **only** in JSON format, no extra text, no Markdown elements.\\n  - Make sure you **always** produce valid JSON. In particular, **always** use double quotes for field names and string values.\\n  - The format for this JSON response is as described in the examples.

population described by the demographic data below. Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, \\n        characteristics of the individuals in the population. \\n\\n        ## Directives\\n        Please follow these rules:\\n            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          - culinary tastes: from traditional American to international cuisine\\n          - shopping habits: from frequent to occasional shoppers\\n          - health consciousness: from health-focused to indulgent\\n          - attitude towards new products: from open-minded to skeptical\\n        \\n        Each dimension should have at least 3 different detailed value descriptions.\\n        \\n\\n

Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, \\n        characteristics of the individuals in the population. \\n\\n        ## Directives\\n        Please follow these rules:\\n            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          -

specification\\n\\n        The population described by the demographic data below. Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, \\n        characteristics of the individuals in the population. \\n\\n        ## Directives\\n        Please follow these rules:\\n            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          - culinary tastes: from traditional American to international cuisine\\n          - shopping habits: from frequent to occasional shoppers\\n          - health consciousness: from health-focused to

Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, \\n        characteristics of the individuals in the population. \\n\\n        ## Directives\\n        Please follow these rules:\\n            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          - culinary tastes: from traditional American to international cuisine\\n          - shopping habits: from frequent to occasional shoppers\\n          - health consciousness: from health-focused to indulgent\\n          - attitude towards new products: from open-minded to skeptical\\n        \\n        Each dimension should have at least 3 different detailed value descriptions.\\n        \\n\\n

specification\\n\\n        The population described by the demographic data below. Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, \\n        characteristics of the individuals in the population. \\n\\n        ## Directives\\n        Please follow these rules:\\n            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample\\n              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.\\n            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, \\n              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, \\n              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.\\n            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, \\n              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.\\n\\n        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering\\n        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:\\n            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;\\n            - from the youngest to the oldest; \\n            - from the kind to the evil;\\n            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;\\n            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;\\n            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; \\n            - from the educated, to the ignorant;\\n            - from the healthy to the sick;\\n            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;\\n            - from rich to poor.   \\n        \\n        Make sure there\\'s sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.\\n        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there\\'s some\\n        information from these rare cases.\\n        \\n        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics \\n        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don\\'t like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).\\n\\n        ## Additional demographic specification (if any)\\n        \\n        BESIDES other dimensions inferred from the population demographic data, \\n        ensure these ADDITIONAL sampling dimensions are present:\\n          - culinary tastes: from traditional American to international cuisine\\n          - shopping habits: from frequent to occasional shoppers\\n          - health consciousness: from health-focused to indulgent\\n          - attitude towards new products: from open-minded to skeptical\\n        \\n        Each dimension should have at least 3 different detailed value descriptions.\\n        \\n\\n
