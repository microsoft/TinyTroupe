        # Sampling space specification

        The population described by the demographic data below. Make sure you consider very detailed, fine-grained, 
        characteristics of the individuals in the population. 

        ## Directives
        Please follow these rules:
            - produce a uniformly distributed sample of the requested population, so that all characteristics are represented in the sample
              in the right proportions, as specified in the demographic data below.
            - consider as many different population segments as possible, while **always** keeping **proportions** correct.For example, 
              instead of sampling 10 people from segment A and 5 from segment B, you can instead sample 2 from A, 1 from B, 
              and 7 others from other segments, provided the proportions are maintained correct and there are enough people to sample.
            - also use any built-in knowledge you might have of the populations in question to improve the sampling space, 
              provided this built-in knowledge does not conflict with the demographic data below.

        The sample must include representative people from the broad population, so for instance ensure that you include values covering
        people from all walks of life possible from the specified demographic data and your built-in knowledge of the target population, such as:
            - from the simplest professions to those of the highest ranks;
            - from the youngest to the oldest; 
            - from the kind to the evil;
            - from the positive and enthusiastic to the negative and pessimistic;
            - from the happy and joyful to the sad and depressed;
            - from the most conservative, to the most liberal; 
            - from the educated, to the ignorant;
            - from the healthy to the sick;
            - from those who enjoy bland food, to those who enjoy spicy food;
            - from rich to poor.   
        
        Make sure there's sufficient variety to represent even extreme cases, so that fringe opinions or far fetched characteristics are also represented.
        Because these are by definition rare, here you can add a larger proportion than what is truly present in the population, so that there's some
        information from these rare cases.
        
        In particular, the population MUST cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics 
        (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don't like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).

        """
        Given a sampling description, computes the dimensions of the sampling space. The sampling space offers a way to sample from a population of people,
        so each dimension contains values that could be an attribute of a **specific** person. The resulting sampling space must:
           - contemplate all critical characteristics mentioned in the sampling description, even if this means having a large number of dimensions and
             complex values for each.
               * whenever necessary to properly capture the possibilities, you can replace a single dimension by a collection of sub-dimensions
             (e.g., instead of "beliefs", you might have "political_beliefs", "economic_beliefs", "consumer_beliefs", etc.)
           - values for each dimension can range from numbers or single words to large sentences or even paragraphs. For attributes that are not clearly single values,
             always try to add as much detail as possible. For instance, age is just a single value, but lifestyle or cultural background **must** be a long sentence or even a paragraph. 
             This is to ensure that, later, the generated people can be very nuanced and realistic, with rich and detailed attributes. See the example below to get inspired.
           - you can be very creative with the dimensions and values provided that they are consistent with the sampling space description.
           - whenever you have the information about PROPORTIONS of the values, you **must** include them in the output, so that the sampling space can be used to generate people
             in a representative way. 
           - values are **not** distributions, probabilities or other statistics, but rather concrete, specific, people attributes. For example, there can
             be no "average_age" dimension, but only "age", although the complete set of valies that define a dimension is itself a distribution.
           - each dimension should be as rich as possible, having as many values as possible, so that the sampling space can be used to generate
             many nuanced variations of the target population.
           - each dimension should consider a wide range of values, making sure to cover both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs don't like sugar).  
           - each dimension should always include extreme values, so that the sampling space can be used to generate people with extreme characteristics, such as very young or very old,
             very rich or very poor, very positive or very negative, etc.
           - include as many dimensions as possible to capture the richness of the population, even if this means having a large number of dimensions.    
           - in principle, the original sampling description could be approximately rephrased in terms of the dimensions and values generated (i.e., the dimensions are rich enough
             to capture all relevant information). Howerver, this should not limit the range of values and dimensions used, but rather be a byproduct of the process. For instance,
             if the original description say "young people", the dimension "age" could be defined as a range of values from 18 to 30, but **not** as a small list with only, say, [18, 25, 30].
             Always try to be as rich as possible in the values and dimensions, even if this means having a large number of them.

        Additionally, make sure you include special dimensions that capture these aspects, in such a way that they relate to the sampling space description:
            - personality traits (with proportions)
            - political beliefs (with proportions)
            - economic beliefs (with proportions)
            - financial situation (with proportions)
            - preferences and tastes (with proportions)
            - cultural background (with proportions and diverse ethnicities and cultural heritages; provide detailed, realistic, and varied examples that reflect a wide spectrum of ethnic, national, and cultural identities relevant to the sampling space description)

        ## On your input

        Here's what to do depending on what the input sampling space description looks like:
          - Plain text: Abstract all the potential dimensions from the text. For example, if the text is "Young Western people of different liberal professions.", the dimensions could be "age", "profession", "country".
          - JSON: Do not use the JSON directly, but rather abstract the dimensions from it. Input JSONs can be obtained from various sources, and you should do your best to interpret them and produce a clean list of dimensions and their values, regardless of how complex the input JSON is. In particular, never use the JSON formatting itself as dimension names or values, but rather abstract the actual dimensions and values from it.
          - Tables or other structured data: Abstract the dimensions from the structured data. For example, if the data is in a table, you should extract the rows and columns and abstract the dimensions from them.
            
        
        ## On your output:
        You output a JSON containing a list of dimensions. Each output dimension **must** consist of:
          - a name;
          - EITHER a list of values OR a range of values (specified as a pair). 
              * in lists of values, whenever possible, you **must** use long values, such as sentences or paragraphs, instead of short words or numbers. 
              * in lists of values you can, optionally, use a dictionary to specify proportions of the values, e.g., {"value1": 0.5, "value2": 0.3, "value3": 0.2} to indicate that 50% of the population has value1, 30% has value2, and 20% has value3.
                Adjust the proportions as appropriate for the context and ensure they sum to 1.0.

        The output is formatted as a JSON object with the following structure:
        ```json	
        {
            "sampling_space_description": "A description of the sampling space.",
            "dimensions": [
            {
            "name": "dimension_name_1",
            "values": ["value1", "value2", ...]
            },

            {
            "name": "dimension_name_2",
            "range": [min, max]
            },

            "name": "dimension_name_3",
            "values": {"value1": proportion1, "value2": proportion2, "value3": proportion3, ...}
            },

            ...
            ]
        }
        ```

        Unless values are necessarily numbers (e.g., age), they should be descriptive strings so that it is easy to understand what they mean.
        These strings can be simple values or long detailed texts, whatever is best to capture the desired characteristic.
        
        ## Example:
        Given the following INPUT sampling space description: "Young Western people of different liberal professions and social classes."

        The OUTPUT dimensions could be a dictionary with the following structure:
           ```json
           {
               "sampling_space_description": "Young Western people of different liberal professions and social classes.",

        Note in the example:

           - The "country" dimension uses a dictionary with suitable proportions for Western countries.
           - No value contains internal structure - just a name or short description.
           - All values are concrete properties, not distributions, probabilities or other statistics.
           - Whenever possible, the values in the dimensions are long and detailed **sentences** each.
           - It has few dimensions because the sampling space description is very short. If the description were longer, the number of dimensions would be larger,
             and their values more detailed.
           - It contains the additional dimensions that capture the personality traits, political beliefs, economic beliefs, financial situation, preferences and tastes,
             and now cultural background with varied ethnicities and heritages, which are important for the sampling space to be rich enough to generate nuanced variations of the target population. 
           - Beyond positive aspects, it also includes values that emphasize pessimism, negativeness, and sadness, ensuring these characteristics are balanced and represented in the sampling space.

        This function defines which and how many people to sample from the sampling space defined by the given dimensions.
        Given a number N of people to sample, and the dimensions of the sampling space, computes a *sample plan* of N people from that space.

        The input sampling dimensions have the following structure:

            ```json
                {
                    "sampling_space_description": "A description of the sampling space.",
                    "dimensions": [
                        {
                            "name": "dimension_name_1",
                            "values": ["value1", "value2", ...]
                        },
                        {
                            "name": "dimension_name_2",
                            "range": [min, max]
                        },
                        ...
                    ]
                }
            ```
        
        The *sample plan* to be generated is a list of M *sampling directives*. Each *sampling directive* **always** consists of:
          - "id": a unique identifier for the *sampling directive*, just an incrementing integer starting from 1.
          - "subpopulation_description": a short description of the sub-population that this *sampling directive* represents, based on the sampling space description and the sampled values.
                                         If possible, make it a recognizable and meaningful description of the sub-population, 
                                         such as "Young rebellious people from upper classes", "Old conservative boomers from rural areas", "Intellectual urban professionals with diverse and cosmopolitan cultural backgrounds", etc.
          - "sampled_values": a map from of dimensions from the sampling space to concrete values, value ranges or value options.
          - "quantity": to how many elements with those values should be sampled in total (from 1 to max_quantity_per_sample_directive if specified). 
                        The sum of all of these quantities must be equal to N.

        So your final output **MUST** follow this JSON structure:

            ```json
            [
                {   "id": 1,

                        "dimension_name_3": ["value3_1", "value3_2", ...],
                        ...
                    },
                    "quantity": quantity_M
                },
            ]
            ```

            where N = quantity_1 + quantity_2 + ... + quantity_M, 
                  quantity_i <= max_quantity_per_sample_directive (if specified),
                  and M is the number of *sampling directives*, which can be as large as necessary to ensure 
                  that the total number of sampled people is equal to N.

            Note:
              - Concrete values are NOT in brackets, but rather just a single value or a range of values.
              - Options are given in lists of strings separated by commas, e.g., ["value1", "value2", ...].
              - Ranges are numberic and specified as a pair of numbers, e.g., [min, max].
                    
        Rules and principles:
          - The sampling plan is a collection of sub-populations captured by each *sampling directive*. Therefore, the various *sampling directives* must complement each other in order
            to approximate the target population.
          - Each *sampling directive* is a **combination** of values from the sampling dimensions that represent a specific segment of the target population. Its richness and variety must reflect the desired sub-population.
          - The dimension sampled in each *sampling directive* can be a single value, a range of values, or a list of values. You can use ranges and lists to cover a wider range of possibilities
            in a compact way, but you can also use single values if necessary. The items in list can be long or short, does not matter, both can be in lists. Some examples of good fortmatting:
                * CORRECT example: ["Very rich", "Rich", "Middle class", "Poor"]
                * CORRECT example: "Rich"
                * WRONG example: ["Very rich or Rich or Middle class or Poor"]
                * WRONG example: ["Rich"] 
          - **Always** try very hard to use a list of values (two or more values) or range of values (min - max), to make the sampling plan at once concise and rich. In doing so, make sure that each *sampling directive* is truly representative
            of some segment of the target population, and not just a random collection of values.                
          - You MUST make M as large as necessary to contemplate the target population, ideally M >= min_sampling_directives (but M <= max_sampling_directives, if specified), to ensure a rich and varied sampling of the population.
              * Note that this means the maximum *sampling directive* "id" (call it max_id) used in the *sampling plan* is such that: max_id >= min_sampling_directives; max_id <= max_sampling_directives (if specified).
          - The sampled population MUST be representative of the target population.
          - The sampled population MUST be realistic.
          - You can set the quantity of each *sampling directive* to 1 if necessary to ensure a varied and representative sampling.
          - All values chosen from the sampling dimensions must be copied IN FULL in the "sampled_values" map, so that the sampled values are concrete and specific.
            The sample plan is supposed to be self-contained, therefore it MUST have all details necessary to sample the people later, without needing to refer back to the sampling dimensions.
          - You should include as many *sampling directives* as necessary to cover the sampling of N total people (the sum of all quantities). When in doubt,
            **always** add more *sampling directives* (i.e., make M larger) up to max_sampling_directives (if specified), as this will ensure you cover the requested N people.
          - In particular, make sure both POSITIVE and NEGATIVE possibilities of the various characteristics are covered (e.g., rich vs poor, likes sugar vs doesn't like sugar, enthusiastic vs apathetic).
            This is to ensure any bias (towards positive or negative characteristics) is minimized, and the sampling space is rich enough to generate people with a wide range of characteristics.
          - The sampling space description should be used to guide the sampling, so that the sampled population is consistent with it.
          - You should ensure that the quantity of requested samples in each *sampling directive* is proportional to their presumed size in the target population.
            That is to say, combinations of dimensions that are more common in the target population should be sampled more often. If you don't know, make a guess.
          - If max_quantity_per_sample_directive is specified, you must ensure that no single *sampling directive* exceeds this quantity. This is to ensure we get more variation and not just a few large groups.
          - You can rely on your built-in knowledge or make educated guesses about such quantities and proportions to ensure that the sample is representative of the population.
              * Note that this means for any quantity_i: quantity_i >= 1; quantity_i <= max_quantity_per_sample_directive (if specified).
          - The sum of all quantities in the output **must** be equal to N, the number of people to sample in total.
          - You can always add extra *sampling directives* (up to max_sampling_directives if specified) to ensure the total of N people is reached.
          - It is acceptable for the sampling plan to generate more than N people, but NEVER less than N. So if unsure generate MORE people, never less.

        ## Example

        An OUTPUT *sample plan* therefore is a LIST with the *sample plan*, where each element is a dictionary with a *sampling directive*. For example, an output based on the above dimensions could look like this:

            - The ouputs consist only of a list of names, nothing else.
            - The output length is exactly 6, which is the requested number of names. There could be a bit more names generated, but never less.

        Args:
            n (int): The number of names to generate.
            already_generated_names (list): The list of already generated names.
            context (str): The context in which the names are being generated. This can be used to guide the name generation, so that it is a realistic name for the context.

        Returns:
            list: A list of n unique full names for people. These names NEVER repeat names in the list of already generated names.

        """
        Generates a single full name for a person based on their complete sample characteristics, such that
        it is as appropriate as possible to all characteristics, not just gender.
        This name MUST BE UNIQUE and not appear in the already_generated_names list, though variations of the 
        same name are allowed. 

        You must generate a realistic full name that is appropriate for the given sample characteristics. 
        Consider ALL the characteristics provided, including but not limited to:
        - Gender
        - Age or age range
        - Country/nationality/ethnicity
        - Socioeconomic status
        - Profession
        - Educational background
        - Cultural background
        - Any other relevant demographic or personal characteristics

        The name should:
        - BE UNIQUE and not appear in the already_generated_names list
        - Be realistic and culturally appropriate for the characteristics
        - Sound natural and not made-up
        - Be unique and not appear in the already_generated_names list
        - Reflect the person's likely background (e.g., names common in their generation, culture, social class)

        If you need additional methods to ensure uniqueness, you can:
        - Use longer or more uncommon names
        - Include middle names or multiple surnames
        - Use culturally appropriate name variations
        - As a last resort, you can append a number, but this should be avoided.


        In ANY CASE, you **must never**, NEVER, generate a name that already appears in the already_generated_names list.

        Return only the full name as a string, nothing else.

        ## Example

        **Input:**
            sample_characteristics: {
                "gender": "female",
                "age": 28,
                "country": "Brazil", 
                "profession": "Software Engineer",
                "socioeconomic_status": "middle class",
                "education": "Computer Science degree"
            }
            already_generated_names: ["João Silva", "Maria Santos", "Ana Costa"]

        **Output:**
            "Camila Rodrigues"

        Args:
            sample_characteristics (dict): The complete characteristics of the sample, including demographics, profession, etc.
            already_generated_names (list): The list of already generated names to avoid duplicates. The new name MUST NOT be in this list.

        Returns:
            str: A single full name appropriate for the sample characteristics.
