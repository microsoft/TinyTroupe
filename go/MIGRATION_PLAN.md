# TinyTroupe Python to Go Migration Plan

This document outlines the structured approach for migrating the Python TinyTroupe implementation to Go.

## Migration Progress

### Latest Updates (2025-08-02)
- âœ… Completed initial gap analysis between Python and Go versions
- âœ… Documented missing modules and features in this migration plan
- âœ… Implemented `BasicSimulationController` with lifecycle management and unit tests
- âœ… Created comprehensive example coverage plan and sample output generation
- âœ… Consolidated documentation structure for better maintainability

### Next Priority Steps
- Integrate simulation controller with other core packages
- Port enrichment, extraction, tools, profiling, steering, experimentation, and ui packages
- Add prompt templates and advanced behaviors for agents
- Continue porting Jupyter notebook examples into runnable Go programs

## Current Status

### âœ… Already Implemented (Basic versions)

   - Debugging utilities
   - Performance tools

4. **Profiling** (`pkg/profiling/`)
   - Performance monitoring
   - Memory usage tracking

## Migration Approach

### 1. Structure-First Approach
- Create directory structure for all modules
- Add basic Go package files with interfaces
- Establish module dependencies and relationships

### 2. Interface-Driven Design
- Define Go interfaces before implementation
- Ensure clean separation of concerns
- Plan for Go-idiomatic patterns (channels, goroutines)

### 3. Test-Driven Migration
- Port tests alongside functionality
- Ensure compatibility with existing features
- Maintain high test coverage

### 4. Progressive Enhancement
- Start with basic functionality
- Add advanced features incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility

## Python vs Go Considerations

### Language Differences
- **Concurrency**: Leverage Go's goroutines for agent simulation
- **Types**: Use Go's strong typing for better safety
- **Error Handling**: Use Go's explicit error handling
- **Performance**: Optimize for Go's strengths

### Architecture Adaptations
- **Interfaces**: Define clear contracts between modules
- **Channels**: Use for agent communication
- **Context**: Use for cancellation and timeouts
- **Dependency Injection**: Use for testability

### Go-Specific Improvements
- **Concurrency**: Parallel agent execution
- **Performance**: Better memory management
- **Type Safety**: Compile-time error detection
- **Deployment**: Single binary deployment

- `tools/migration/` - Migration utilities and helpers

### Quality Gates
- Linting with `golangci-lint`

## Next Steps

1. Create basic package structure for all modules
2. Implement Phase 1 modules (control, factory, utils, validation)
3. Set up migration tools and scripts
4. Begin systematic porting of Python functionality

This plan provides a structured approach to migrate from Python to Go while maintaining quality and adding Go-specific improvements.## Gap Analysis vs Python Implementation

A review of the original [tinytroupe Python repository](../tinytroupe-python) highlights modules and example assets that are not yet feature-complete in this Go port. The table below maps each Python component to its status in this repository and captures missing work.

| Python component | Go status | Gap / Required work |
|------------------|-----------|---------------------|
| `agent` package | `pkg/agent` basic implementation âœ… | Add prompt templates and advanced behaviors |
| `control.py` | `pkg/control` basic implementation âœ… | Expand orchestration and persistence |
| `environment` package | `pkg/environment` basic implementation âœ… | Expand world dynamics and state persistence |
| `factory` package | `pkg/factory` implemented âœ… | Integrate with config and validation |
| `enrichment` package | `pkg/enrichment` placeholder ðŸš§ | Port enrichment prompts and logic |
| `extraction` package | `pkg/extraction` placeholder ðŸš§ | Implement data export and analytics |
| `tools` package | `pkg/tools` placeholder ðŸš§ | Provide tooling utilities and instrumentation |
| `profiling.py` | `pkg/profiling` placeholder ðŸš§ | Add performance tracking and metrics |
| `steering` package | `pkg/steering` placeholder ðŸš§ | Implement behavior steering mechanisms |
| `experimentation` package | `pkg/experimentation` placeholder ðŸš§ | Add A/B testing and experimental hooks |
| `ui` package | `pkg/ui` placeholder ðŸš§ | Build developer UX components |
| `validation` package | `pkg/validation` implemented âœ… | Extend with custom rule sets |
| `utils` package | `pkg/utils` implemented âœ… | Add remaining helper parity |
| `openai_utils.py` | `pkg/openai` implemented âœ… | Ensure parity for all API helpers |
| `examples` notebooks & JSON assets | `examples/` partial ðŸš§ | Port notebooks to Go examples and copy agent/fragments |

These gaps form the basis for the progression documented in `MIGRATION_PROGRESS.md` and will be addressed to achieve feature parity.
