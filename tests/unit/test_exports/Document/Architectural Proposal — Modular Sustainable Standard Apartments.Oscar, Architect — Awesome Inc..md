## 1. Assumptions & Project Basis (expanded)

This scheme is based on a representative example project to make costs and program illustrative and actionable. All figures and targets are preliminary and intended to support early decisions. Final figures must be validated by a QS, engineers and statutory authorities.

Project baseline
- Site typology: inner-urban infill plot with good road access, municipal services available within 50–100 m. Typical German municipality planning framework (local land-use plan / Bebauungsplan to be confirmed).
- Building size (example): 2,000 m² Gross Floor Area (GFA) across 5 above-ground storeys (+ possible set-back roof plant area).
- Typical unit count: 25 apartments (mix sorted approximately to achieve target average net area per unit).
- Unit average net area: approx. 70–85 m² (ranges by type; layout dependent).
- Floor-to-floor height (typical): 2.85–3.10 m in main stacks; ground floor may be 3.3–3.6 m to accommodate lobby/possible retail.
- Quality target: mid-range finishes as baseline; upgrade options to premium sustainable finishes available to buyers.
- Delivery target: practical completion within 12–18 months from mobilisation (modular share dependent).
- Cost basis: hard construction costs only (building works). Excludes land, VAT, financing, major external infrastructure beyond normal connection fees. Contingency, professional fees and risk allowances presented separately.
- Regulatory compliance: the design will target compliance with applicable German building regulations (Bauordnung des jeweiligen Bundeslandes), Energieeinsparverordnung/EEG-derived targets, and local fire safety requirements. Final compliance checks and approvals occur during Detailed Design/permit stage by local consultants and authorities.

Key site / programme unknowns to be resolved early
- Plot geometry, orientation and setback requirements (for daylight & solar PV).
- Parking requirement (on-plot or off-site), access for deliveries and module crane setup.
- Ground conditions: geotechnical report required to confirm shallow foundations vs. pile requirements.
- Local energy/incentive regulations (e.g., requirements for PV, connection to district heating or heat pumps).
- Permitted building heights and façade treatment constraints.

Data sources and inflation assumption
- Preliminary cost bands referenced to typical German market conditions (2023–2025). Client should expect inflation and supply-chain changes. For budgeting, include a procurement/inflation allowance (e.g., 3–5% per year if procurement window extends beyond 12 months).

---

## 2. Design Concept & Rationale (detailed)

Design Principles
- Standardization: adopt a limited catalogue of repeatable elements (kitchens, bathrooms, joinery, balconies, parapets, MEP risers) to enable volume procurement, faster approvals and predictable quality.
- Modularity: use prefabricated volumetric modules (full apartment modules and element-based modules such as sanitary pods) to reduce onsite labour and accelerate schedule.
- Hybrid structure: combine timber modules for superstructure with a reinforced concrete (RC) core for vertical circulation and lateral stability to achieve structural robustness, fire safety and efficient construction sequencing.
- Flexibility and configurability: create 3–5 standardized module footprints that can be combined to create different unit sizes/configurations. This supports buyer choice while preserving manufacturing economies.
- Sustainability: prioritize embodied carbon reduction (timber where feasible), operational efficiency (heat pumps, MVHR), and provision for onsite renewables (PV).
- Human-centred design: good daylight, cross-ventilation options, balconies and integrated planting to improve occupant well-being.

Architectural language
- Clean modernist proportions with generous fenestration and clear expression of terraces/balconies.
- Durable, low-maintenance materials on primary facades (e.g., brick slips or fibre-cement rainscreen) and timber expression on balconies or screens where permitted.
- Ground-floor active frontage (where relevant) with enhanced access and accessibility features.

Module sizing and assembly logic
- Standard volumetric module widths: 3.0 m, 3.6 m and 4.2 m (examples) to align with structural spans and standard timber panel widths; module depths typically 6.0–8.0 m depending on plan.
- Inter-module connection detail: mechanical fixings, service junction boxes at module interfaces, continuity of airtightness via perimeter gaskets and external membranes.
- Standard vertical service corridor: a centralised riser per 2–3 module stacks to minimise distribution runs.

Balconies & outdoors
- Provide at least one private outdoor space per unit (balcony or loggia). Typical area: 4–8 m² depending on unit type.
- Integrated planter boxes / green screens to improve biophilia and aid shading.

Buyer configurability
- Pre-defined options catalogue: each buyer chooses one package from kitchen, bathroom, flooring, and a small range of appliance/fixture upgrades. Major plan changes not permitted once module is manufactured.
- Upgrade windows to slightly larger units at specified positions within module grid (if chosen early).
- Allow limited personalization items (colour, cabinetry handles, optional skylight in top-floor duplexes).

---

## 4. Materials & Sustainability Measures (detailed)

Sustainability is approached across embodied carbon, operational energy, water use, materials, and end-of-life considerations.

Primary structure
- Superstructure: cross-laminated timber (CLT) or engineered timber modules where permitted by local codes.
  - Benefits: lower embodied carbon relative to reinforced concrete, faster onsite erection, predictable factory-controlled quality.
  - Considerations: acoustics between apartments (require floating floors, resilient mounts), fire protection (encapsulation or intumescent coatings), and moisture management.
- Core and base: reinforced concrete core (stair/elevator) and ground-floor transfer where heavy loads or basement adjacent structures are required.

Envelope & thermal performance
- Continuous external insulation (e.g., external EPS or mineral wool with a rainscreen façade) or insulated timber frame panel with vapour-open membranes as appropriate.
- Airtightness target: ≤ 1.0 ACH@50Pa (aim for 0.6–0.8 for higher-performance options). Design for testability and commissioning of airtightness.
- Thermal bridging: design continuous cavity and detail junctions with thermal bridge free connectors or insulation boxes.

Renewables & energy strategy
- Heating: air-source heat pumps as baseline; ground-source heat pumps considered where borehole feasibility and economics justify (site dependent).
- Ventilation: centralized or decentralized MVHR system with heat recovery (target sensible recovery efficiency ≥ 75–85%).
- Domestic hot water: heat-pump-based DHW cylinders sized per unit or centralised DHW store with plate heat exchanger and pump distribution.
- PV readiness: design roofs with structure, load allowance and conduit routes; baseline allowance for 10–20 kWp depending on roof area (example for 2,000 m² GFA, approx. 25–40 kWp).
- Smart meter & load management: provision for sub-metering per apartment and basic load management for PV export/charging.

Water & waste
- Low-flow sanitary fittings: flow restrictors, dual-flush toilets to reduce consumption by 20–30% vs conventional fixtures.
- Greywater reuse: optional greywater system for irrigation and toilet flushing where allowed; typical payback depends on local water tariffs.
- Waste handling: designated space at ground level for separated waste streams, bulky waste collection point and bicycle storage.

Embodied carbon & certification
- Aim to reduce embodied carbon through timber selection, recycled content in concrete and low-impact finishes.
- Certification possibilities: DGNB (German Sustainable Building Council), BNB (BewertungsSystem Nachhaltiges Bauen) or a client-selected international scheme. Certification adds cost for documentation, additional design and commissioning work; budget add-on typically 0.5–1.5% of construction cost for process costs (plus any performance-driven premiums).

Durability & maintenance
- Use robust outdoor materials for balconies/terraces with design life of 30–50 years.
- Choose maintenance-friendly finishes and create clear maintenance schedules for MVHR filters, heat pump services, and façade inspections.

Lifecycle cost approach
- Present both First Cost (capex) and 10–30 year operational cost scenarios to client; small additional investments in building envelope or PV typically provide faster payback in high energy price environments.

---

## 5. Technical Outline (high level, expanded)

Foundations
- Typical approach: shallow strip or raft slab foundations based on standard urban infill geotechnical conditions.
- Geotechnical survey required: assess bearing capacity, groundwater, fill zones and contamination risk.
- Piled foundations: if poor soils or adjacent structures require deep foundations, budgets may increase by 10–30% or more.

Core & structure
- Reinforced concrete core for stairs and elevators; core provides lateral stability.
- Timber modular units stacked and connected to floor plates with mechanical fixings and load transfer details.
- Lateral load path: modules connected to core with shear keys; wind and seismic loads to be checked by structural engineer.
- Fire structural strategy: ensure module-to-module fire stops, protected connections and compliance with local fire resistance periods (e.g., REI 60 or REI 90 depending on code and building use).

Modular manufacture & installation
- Modules manufactured in factory to a high degree of completeness (kitchen, bathroom pods pre-installed if volumetric modules used).
- Logistics: modules transported by articulated lorry; crane-lift operations require site staging, road-strength checks, temporary traffic management.
- Tolerances: specified interface tolerances for module alignment; allowance for on-site trimming and adjustments (dovetail plates or wedge systems).

MEP (Mechanical, Electrical & Plumbing)
- Heating: centralised heat pump plant with distribution to apartments via plate heat exchangers or direct-fed hydronic circuits as per chosen strategy.
- Ventilation: MVHR plant either centralized with distribution ducts per module or decentralized units integrated into modules.
- Domestic Hot Water (DHW): option 1 — small heat-pump water heaters per module; option 2 — central DHW store with distribution and recirculation (trade-off between energy efficiency and pipework complexity).
- Electrical: main incoming supply, distribution board for each floor or cluster; individual apartment metering and essential circuits for appliances, lighting, EV-charging readiness at communal parking.
- Low-voltage systems: structured data cabling to living room and master bedroom; provision for TV point and future connectivity.
- Fire alarm & detection: Grade as per local code; integration with sprinkler systems where required.
- Acoustic requirements: airborne and impact sound reduction between dwellings to meet local legal minimums (typically Ln,w ≤ 53 dB or better for new builds; aim 45–48 dB for improved comfort).

Fire safety & life-safety systems
- Compartmentation: apartments as fire compartments; fire-resisting walls/floors to required REI rating.
- Sprinkler strategy: consider project-level requirement; if timber modules are used, sprinklers may be required or recommended by fire engineer; sprinkler installation adds cost but reduces insurance premiums and can enable more timber use.
- Evacuation: stair core capacity, refuge spaces where necessary, and accessible egress routes for occupants with reduced mobility.

Testing & commissioning
- Commissioning plan with staged testing (factory acceptance tests for modules, onsite mechanical and electrical commissioning, MVHR balancing, airtightness blower door testing, acoustic testing).
- Hand-over manual including operation & maintenance manuals for all major plant and warranty certificates.

---

## 6. Accessibility, Universal Design & Compliance (specifics)

Accessibility targets
- At least 10–15% of units designed as accessible or adaptable for occupants with mobility limitations (target ≥ 1–3 units in a 25-unit scheme).
- Type of accessible units: ground floor fully step-free; upper-floor units optional by lift access; minimum doorway widths 900 mm; level access wet-room or 1200 x 900 mm shower for accessible units.
- Thresholds: flush transitions between external threshold and internal flooring where feasible.

Inclusive features
- Step-free route from street to building entrance, with tactile paving at kerb cuts and weather-protected entrance.
- Elevator with minimum 1100 x 1400 mm internal dimensions and 630 kg capacity at baseline; larger if stretch goals for bariatric access.
- Visual contrast strips at step edges, accessible light switches, and easy-to-operate door furniture complying with DIN accessibility standards.

Regulatory and compliance framework
- Compliance with German building code (Landesbauordnung), DIN standards for accessibility and fire, and local municipality additions.
- Liaise early with local building authority (Bauamt) for variance, deviations or pre-approval for timber modularity.

## 7. Cost Analysis — Approach & Extended Scenarios

Overview
- Three indicative cost bands presented: Cost-focused, Mid-range baseline, High-quality sustainable premium. These are construction hard costs per m² GFA and do not include land, VAT, finance, or developer margin.

Scenario cost bands (construction hard costs, excl. land & VAT)
- Cost-focused (lower-spec, high economy): €1,800 – €2,200 / m²
- Mid-range (recommended baseline): €2,300 – €2,800 / m²
- High-quality / sustainable premium: €3,000 – €3,600+ / m²

Indicative elemental cost split (percent of hard costs)
- Substructure & foundations: 8–12%
- Structure & shell (incl. timber modules, core): 30–40%
- Roof & external envelope: 8–10%
- Internal finishes & fit-out: 18–22%
- MEP (mechanical, electrical & plumbing): 18–22%
- External works & landscaping: 5–10%
- Balconies, terraces & special items: 4–8%
- Site preliminaries, temporary works & allowance sums: 6–10%
Note: percentages will vary by scenario and local market.

Worked example — Mid-range baseline (detailed)

Project example parameters
- GFA assumed: 2,000 m²
- Unit count: 25
- Mid-range cost assumption: €2,500 / m² (midpoint)
- Baseline hard construction cost: 2,000 m² × €2,500 / m² = €5,000,000

Itemised cost breakdown (example, indicative)
- Substructure & foundations (10%): €500,000
- Structure & shell (timber modules + RC core) (35%): €1,750,000
- Roof & external envelope (8%): €400,000
- Internal finishes & fit-out (20%): €1,000,000
- MEP (20%): €1,000,000
- External works & landscaping (5%): €250,000
- Balconies & special prefabrication premium (7%): €350,000
- Site preliminaries / contingency within hard cost / provisional sums (5%): €250,000

Subtotal (construction hard cost): €5,000,000

Additional project allowances
- Contingency (10%): €500,000
- Professional fees (architect, structural, MEP, QS, legal, planning including permit fees) — assume 7% of hard cost: €350,000
- Surveys, permits & tests (geotech, ecology, hazardous materials, acoustic tests, fire strategy fees): €50,000
- Client-level allowances (furniture for common areas, marketing fitout at sales office if required): €50,000

Total project budget (excl. land & VAT): €5,950,000 (rounded to €5,900,000 in initial summary; small rounding differences arise from category breakdown rounding)

Per-unit calculation
- Total project cost per unit (25 units): €5,950,000 / 25 = €238,000 per unit (construction + contingency & professional fees, excl. land & VAT)

Alternative scenarios (recomputed with same additional allowances)
- Cost-focused @ €2,000 / m²:
  - Hard cost: €4,000,000
  - Contingency (10%): €400,000
  - Professional fees (7%): €280,000
  - Surveys & permits: €50,000
  - Total: €4,730,000
  - Per unit: €189,200

- High-quality @ €3,300 / m²:
  - Hard cost: €6,600,000
  - Contingency (10%): €660,000
  - Professional fees (7%): €462,000
  - Surveys & permits: €50,000
  - Total: €7,772,000
  - Per unit: €310,880

Detailed sensitivity analysis (two-way)
- Inflation sensitivity: a 5% cost inflation across hard costs raises the mid-range total by €250,000 in the worked example (before contingency/professional fees). Consider an inflation allowance in long procurement schedules.
- Foundation risk sensitivity: adding piled foundations could increase substructure cost from €500k to €1.25M (+€750k), shifting total to approx. €6.7M.
- Prefabrication premium vs on-site labour trade-off: prefabrication reduces the onsite programme but may have a 5–12% premium in factory costs depending on volumes. Achievable savings arise from reduced preliminaries and shortened site programme.

Element-level cost table (mid-range example)

| Element                                 | % of Hard Cost | Indicative € (of €5,000,000) |

Notes on cost categories
- Structure & shell includes timber modules, RC core, connections, and primary finishes to module exteriors.
- Internal finishes & fit-out includes kitchens, bathroom pods, floor finishes, internal doors, fitted storage and painting.
- MEP includes plant (heat pumps, MVHR), electrical distribution, domestic hot water provision, site drainage, small plant rooms and associated control systems.
- Balconies are often priced and treated as separate add-on items due to detail complexity and cantilevered structural support.

Financing and VAT considerations
- VAT on construction in Germany typically applies; include separate calculation depending on the client and local tax advice.
- Financing interest during construction should be modelled by developer separately and can materially affect overall project cost.

## 8. Procurement & Contracting Strategy

Recommended contracting strategy
1. Early Contractor Involvement (ECI): engage a contractor or modular manufacturer during design development (30–50% DD) to align module sizes, logistics, and costing.
2. Two-stage tender recommended for complex modular projects: Stage 1 — select contractor/manufacturer based on capability and price frameworks; Stage 2 — final pricing after technical design freeze.
3. Procure long-lead items early: MVHR units, heat pumps, kitchen cabinetry, windows and specialized connectors.
4. Tender lots recommended:
   - Lot 1: Site enabling, foundations & RC core.
   - Lot 2: Timber/modular manufacturing & installation.
   - Lot 3: MEP plant & distribution (plantroom & apartment-level connections).
   - Lot 4: Internal finishes & fitout (if modules are supplied unfinished internally).
   - Lot 5: External works & landscaping.

Selection criteria for modular manufacturer/contractor
- Factory capacity and backlog; ability to meet required delivery window.
- Past performance in similar timber/modular residential projects.
- Quality assurance processes (ISO 9001 or equivalent).
- Financial stability and bonds/guarantees capability.
- Willingness to participate in ECI and collaborate on design adjustments to reduce cost.

Contract form suggestions
- Two-stage NEC4 Option A/B or alternative JCT variant with design responsibility clarified for the module manufacturer vs architect/engineer.
- Consider incentivised cost and time models for modular delivery, with clear stage gates linked to manufacturing slots.

Procurement timeline (high-level)
- QS elemental cost plan: 2–3 weeks after briefing.
- Prequalification & ECI selection: 6–8 weeks.
- Manufacturing lead time: 12–20 weeks depending on plant capacity and module complexity.
- Onsite installation: 6–12 weeks for module craning & connection; finishing works on modules (if partially completed) may be required concurrently.

| MEP connections, fit-out & commissioning   | 8–12              | Week 40                    | Modules set |
| External works & landscaping               | 4–8               | Week 44                    | Module assembly |
| Practical completion & handover            | 2–4               | Week 52–78                 | Commissioning |

Notes:
- Many activities can overlap; manufacturing can start before full permits if risk accepted by client (subject to ECI and planning risk).
- Permitting time is highly variable. Early engagement with local authority is essential.
- The programme assumes rapid approvals and no significant site surprises.

Gantt-style summary (simplified)
- Weeks 0–8: Brief, concept, QS and initial ECI selection.
- Weeks 8–20: Design development with contractor input; freeze module geometry.
- Weeks 20–40: Manufacture modules; enabling & below-ground works.
- Weeks 36–48: Erection and assembly, plant installation, fit-out.
- Weeks 48–60: Testing, commissioning, practical completion.

Notes:
- Clear division of design responsibility must be contractually defined, particularly for module manufacturing details and finishes scope.
- Early engagement of QS and contractors reduces risk of design choices pushing cost beyond target.

## 11. Cost-reduction Strategies (expanded and prioritized)

Practical recommendations ranked by potential cost impact and feasibility:

High impact (early-stage actions)
1. Standardize unit layouts and finishes (high impact) — limit layout variants and lock finishes early to reduce order complexity.
2. Early Contractor Involvement (ECI) (high impact) — secure manufacturing slots and value-engineer module geometry.
3. Optimize module dimensions to shipping/economy widths (high/medium impact) — avoid special-width modules that require bespoke transport.
4. Conservative allowance for foundations until geotech report is complete (medium/high impact) — early geotech reduces unknowns.

Medium impact (design & procurement)
5. Use prefabricated sanitary pods and kitchen wall modules (medium impact) — reduce onsite trades and improve quality control.
6. Combine trades into integrated packages (medium impact) — single point contractor responsibility for MEP & fit-out reduces coordination costs.
7. Review external works scope for phasing (low/medium) — delay or simplify landscaping to reduce early capital.

Lower-cost quick wins
8. Bulk procurement of long-lead items (lighting, sanitaryware) with staged deliveries.
9. Simplify façade details with durable cladding that requires less bespoke manufacture.
10. Limit bespoke joinery and reduce custom sizes to standard modules.

Value engineering moments
- 30% DD stage: review large-ticket items (PV scope, balconies, premium finishes).
- Pre-tender: freeze module dimensions to avoid late cost creep.

## 12. Risk Register & Mitigation

Key risks, likelihood, impact, and mitigation measures

| Risk                                 | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|-------------------------------------:|:----------:|:------:|:-----------|
| Permit delays / planning objections  | Medium     | High   | Early stakeholder engagement; pre-application meetings; allocate 12–20 weeks in program; design to local policy. |
| Adverse geotechnical conditions     | Low/Medium | High   | Early geotechnical survey; provisional contingency for piled foundations; contingency in budget. |
| Material price inflation            | High       | Medium | Fixed-price procurement where possible; inflation clause management; contingency allowances. |

| Onsite logistics (crane access)     | Medium     | Medium | Early logistics study; permit and traffic management plan; alternative crane locations. |
| Fire regulation tightening          | Low/Medium | Medium/High | Fire engineer engagement early; consider sprinkler baseline if timber used. |
| Acoustic performance & complaints   | Medium     | Medium | Design resilient acoustic interfaces; perform pre-completion acoustic testing. |
| Supply chain failure (appliances)   | Medium     | Low/Medium | Early procurement and on-time logistics; provide substitutions with client approval. |
| Higher-than-expected demand for upgrades | Medium  | Medium | Clear upgrade pricing schedule; manage buyer expectations with timeline and lead times. |

3. Commission geotechnical and topographical surveys to identify foundation and access constraints. Owner: Client. (2–4 weeks)

Short-term actions (week 4–12)
4. Proceed to Schematic Design to finalize module grid, unit catalogue and massing. Owner: Oscar / Awesome Inc. (6–8 weeks)
5. Select sustainability targets (DGNB, NZEB or client-specific) to define envelope, MVHR and energy performance requirements. Owner: Client + Oscar + Sustainability consultant. (1–2 weeks decision)
6. Begin pre-qualification of modular manufacturers and contractors; issue ECI brief. Owner: Client + QS. (6–8 weeks)

Pre-procurement (week 12–20)
7. Value-engineering review at 30–50% detailed design with contractor input to finalize packaged procurement strategy and to lock in long-lead items and manufacturing slots.
8. Prepare and submit permit documentation; coordinate with local authority for early review cycles.

Long-lead and programme control
9. Reserve factory production capacity while detailed design is finalised; negotiate production slots and adverse weather/strike clauses.
10. Plan logistics (crane lifts, road closure permits) with local authority and crane supplier at least 12 weeks ahead of module delivery.

Optional next deliverables offered
- Refine numbers to match a real site (provide plot address or site parameter set).
- Produce unit floorplans and modular details in CAD/SKETCHUP for client review.
- Prepare tender documentation for QS and assist with procurement (two-stage tender pack).

## 14. Appendix A — Detailed Worked Example: Unit-level Cost and Area Breakdown

Example building: 2,000 m² GFA, 25 units. Below is an illustrative per-unit cost and area breakdown for the mid-range scenario:

Assumptions
- Unit mix (example):
  - 6 × Type A (1BR @ 55 m²)
  - 13 × Type B (2BR @ 78 m²)
  - 6 × Type C (3BR @ 95 m²)
- Circulation, cores, plant room and walls account for 15–20% of GFA.

Area distribution (approximate)
- Net internal area total: sum of unit nets ≈ 1,750 m²
- Common circulation & plant: 250 m² (this is illustrative and will vary)

Per-unit cost breakdown (mid-range, approximate per unit)
- Average mid-range per-unit total (incl. contingency & fees): €238,000
- Allocation example for an average 78 m² 2BR unit:
  - Structure & shell share: €62,500
  - Internal finishes & fit-out (kitchen, bathrooms): €47,500
  - MEP apportioned: €47,500
  - Balconies & special items: €10,500
  - External works & communal: €9,000
  - Pro-rated preliminaries & site costs: €13,500
  - Professional fees & contingency (apportioned): €47,000

Note: Smaller units have higher cost per m² due to fixed MEP and communal apportionments.

## 16. Appendix C — Decision Matrix: Timber vs Full RC

Criteria comparison to help choose primary structure

- Carbon footprint:
  - Timber: lower embodied carbon.
  - RC: higher embodied carbon (but possibility to use recycled aggregates/cement reduction).
- Fire performance:
  - Timber: requires encapsulation / fire design; sprinklering may be needed/ recommended.
  - RC: inherent fire resistance; simpler to meet high REI ratings.
- Acoustic performance:
  - Timber modular: extra attention to inter-floor impact sound; additional floating floors required.
  - RC: typically better baseline acoustic performance.
- Programme:
  - Timber modular: faster onsite erection, shorter program.
  - RC: longer onsite schedule for cast-in-place operations.
- Cost:
  - Timber modules can be competitively priced but may include premium for on-factory finishes; RC cost varies with complexity and site constraints.

Recommendation: Hybrid approach (RC core + timber modules) recommended for balance between speed, carbon reduction and risk mitigation.
