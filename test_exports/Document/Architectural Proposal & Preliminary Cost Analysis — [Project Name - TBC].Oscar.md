## 1. Executive summary
This document presents a concept-level architectural proposal and indicative budget for the design and delivery of a new apartment building on an urban infill site in Germany. It provides:

- A design approach that balances efficiency, daylight, privacy and buildability.
- A sample unit mix and typical apartment sizes to demonstrate yield and circulation efficiency.
- A comprehensive preliminary cost estimate (Order of Magnitude) including worked calculations based on a representative Gross Floor Area (GFA) of 2,500 m² using a mid-range unit rate of €2,200/m².
- A breakdown of construction cost elements, professional fees, and contingency with sensitivity analysis.
- Sustainability options and recommendations (energy target, MVHR, heat-pump systems and potential eligibility for KfW support).
- A detailed preliminary schedule with recommended milestones and responsible parties.
- A risk register and procurement recommendations to reduce budget and programme uncertainty.

All figures here are indicative. Final budgets and programme depend on confirmed site constraints, statutory requirements, structural and MEP design, contractor pricing, and tender results.

## 2. Project assumptions (please confirm)
The following assumptions underpin the concept design and cost estimates. Please review and confirm or amend these to refine subsequent design and cost work.

Key assumptions
- Site: urban infill site in Germany; exact address and site constraints to be provided. Typical urban plot with 18–25 m street frontage and 30–40 m depth assumed for massing studies.
- GFA (assumed for worked example): 2,500 m². Replace with confirmed GFA as soon as available.
- Net/Gross efficiency target: 75–80% (we use 78% for worked examples where needed).
- Typical building height: 4–7 storeys (mid-rise), depending on local plan and context.
- Number of apartments: design examples use a range of 16–28 units depending on unit mix and average sizes.
- Target standard: mid-range / high-quality finishes (durable, low-maintenance, energy-efficient). Premium and economy finishes are also modelled in alternative scenarios.
- Parking: assumption is mixed, with some surface or underground parking; default scenario excludes extensive basement parking. Basement/underground parking will materially affect cost and programme.
- Authorities approvals: local building permit (Bauantrag) and national energy code compliance (GEG). Other approvals may include local planning (Bebauungsplan), heritage (if applicable), and fire authority (Feuerwehr).
- Unit services: stacked service risers and central cores to maintain efficiency and reduce MEP routing costs.
- Geotechnical conditions: assumed typical for an urban German site (no extreme contamination, groundwater or rock). Actual soil conditions to be confirmed by geotechnical survey.

Please confirm or update these items to allow refinement of cost and design.

## 3. Project objectives
Primary objectives
- Deliver a well-proportioned residential building providing flexible apartment types (1–3 bedroom mix) that respond to market demand and developer targets.
- Maximise net usable residential area per GFA while ensuring comfortable layouts, daylight and cross-ventilation where possible.
- Prioritise long-term value through robust detailing, durable materials, and energy-efficient building services.
- Standardise repetitive elements (kitchens, bathrooms, internal doors, window sizes) to reduce variation and construction cost, while providing a limited palette of upgrade options for buyers/tenants.
- Ensure compliance with applicable building regulations and deliver adaptable and accessible units (aspiring to at least 5% adaptable units).
- Incorporate sustainability measures that reduce operational energy and carbon; explore funding routes (KfW) that incentivise energy performance.

Secondary objectives
- Maintain a buildable concept that minimises temporary works and complex structural solutions.
- Achieve a cost plan with transparent contingencies and professional fees to support developer decision-making.
- Provide procurement and delivery recommendations to reduce cost and programme risk.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) proposed for project evaluation
- Net/gross efficiency target: 75–80% (goal 78%).
- Average apartment size target: 60–85 m² (dependent on market).
- Heating demand target: < 40 kWh/m²a (for KfW 55 target; lower targets for higher KfW levels).
- Embodied carbon consideration: explore hybrid timber-concrete approach to reduce embodied carbon by up to ~15–25% versus full concrete for superstructure (subject to detailed assessment).
- Cost target (construction): indicative mid-range €2,200/m² (GFA). Developer to confirm budget tolerance.

## 4. Concept design approach

4.1 Massing & urban strategy
- Proposed approach: compact rectangular/orthogonal mass to optimise plan efficiency and structural regularity. Massing to respond to street alignment and neighbouring building heights.
- Building setbacks and transition zones: provide stepping at upper storeys where required by local plan or to reduce visual bulk. Balconies set back to create privacy buffers to adjacent properties.
- Sun/path studies: position living rooms and main glazing to the east/west/south elevations where possible; avoid deep-plan layouts that require artificial lighting during daytime.

4.2 Typical floorplate & circulation
- Central core(s) containing lift(s) and stair(s). For buildings with up to 12 units per core, one lift + one staircase is typically adequate; larger cores may require an additional escape stair depending on fire strategy.
- Core sizing: lift cabin minimum 1.1–1.4 m x 1.4–1.4 m to meet accessibility (platform lift not acceptable for multi-storey residential).
- Circulation strategy: stacked wet walls and service risers to reduce lateral MEP distribution and heat loss.

4.3 Apartment typologies (example)
- Type A — 1BR / 1B (approx. 45–55 m²). Suitable for single professionals and couples. Open-plan living/kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, storage/wardrobe.
- Type B — 2BR / 1–2B (approx. 65–80 m²). Target family market and sharers. Separate living/dining, two bedrooms, bathroom + en-suite or second WC where possible.
- Type C — 3BR / 2B (approx. 85–100 m²). Family units with clear bedroom separation and better storage.
- Adaptable / accessible unit variant: provide threshold-free circulation, bathroom layouts allowing future adaptation (reinforced walls for grab rails).

Example unit mix scenarios (for GFA = 2,500 m²). See Appendix A for a sample area schedule and plan sketches.

4.4 Typical floor efficiency & servicing
- Net/gross target: 75–80% (we assume 78%). This implies circulation, cores and plant represent ~22% of GFA.
- Typical stacked services: kitchens and wet rooms aligned vertically to limit horizontal MEP runs and reduce penetrations.
- Mechanical plant: plant located in basement/ground or roof plant room to minimise noise and maintain headroom.

4.5 Balconies, terraces & private outdoor space
- Balconies: approximate size 4–8 m² per apartment where possible, positioned to provide afternoon sun and privacy screens to adjacent apartments.
- Privacy and shading: use perforated screens, planting zones or brise-soleil where necessary.

4.6 Acoustic & daylighting targets
- Daylight: target average daylight factor (ADF) in living areas to meet recommended values (varies with room geometry). Use larger glazing ratios on primary façades and careful recess depth for balconies.
- Acoustic: comply with DIN 4109 for sound insulation; target higher standards (e.g., 5 dB better than statutory) where adjacent to busy roads.

---

## 5. Materials, systems & sustainability

5.1 Structure options and implications
- Reinforced concrete: conventional for mid-rise urban buildings in Germany. Advantages: predictable cost, fire resistance, sound insulation, thermal mass. Typical superstructure cost share used in budget.
- Hybrid timber-concrete: cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels with concrete cores/ground floor. Advantages: reduced embodied carbon, faster erection, lighter foundations. Considerations: higher material cost (premium ~5–10%), coordination for MEP penetrations, fire detailing and acoustic joints.
- Structural cost sensitivity: hybrid timber could increase superstructure cost by ~€50–100/m², but may reduce schedule by several weeks and lower embodied carbon.

5.2 Façade & thermal performance
- Preferred façade strategies:
  - Insulated masonry or blockwork with external render (cost-effective, robust).
  - Prefabricated ventilated rainscreen with insulation (improved detailing, modularity).
- Windows: high-performance triple-glazed where required. Target Uw ≤ 1.1 W/m²K for window assemblies (frames + glazing).
- Airtightness: target n50 ≤ 1.0–1.5 h⁻¹ at concept; better performance recommended (n50 ≤ 1.0) to reduce heating demand and meet KfW/low-energy targets.

5.3 Building services (HVAC & ventilation)
- Heating: decentralized heat-pump systems (air-source heat pumps for each dwelling or central heat pump with distribution) depending on building size and space constraints.
- Domestic hot water: consider centralised domestic hot water with heat-pump preheat and solar thermal or PV-assisted backup for peak demand reduction.
- Ventilation: mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) is recommended where budget allows. For mid-range cost planning MVHR delivers energy savings, good IAQ and supports airtight construction.
- Cooling: passive measures (shading, thermal mass). Localised cooling or ducted systems only if the client requires.

Performance targets and indicative values:
- Heat demand: aim < 40 kWh/m²a for heating (aspiring to KfW 55 or better).
- Primary energy demand: target in line with GEG and KfW requirements (values to be set once final building form and systems are defined).
- Renewable energy provision: photovoltaic (PV) on roof to supply common area loads and charging infrastructure; explore battery storage to smooth demand profiles.

5.4 Water, finishes & internal fit-out
- Low-flow sanitary fittings to reduce water demand (e.g., 6–9 l/min showers, dual-flush toilets).
- Durable internal finishes: engineered timber flooring in living areas, porcelain tiles in wet rooms, resilient flooring in service areas.
- Kitchen & bathroom strategy: standard modular kitchen and bathroom options with two or three upgrade choices. Standardization reduces bespoke joinery costs.

5.5 Sustainable materials & embodied carbon
- Embodied carbon targets: early-stage assessment recommended. Hybrid timber strategies can potentially reduce embodied carbon by 15–25% relative to concrete-only superstructures (subject to substructure and cladding choices).
- Material selection: low-VOC paints, responsibly-sourced timber (FSC), locally-sourced masonry where practical.

5.6 Waste, recycling & circularity
- Construction waste management plan required during works; target 85–90% diversion from landfill.
- Design for disassembly: where possible use mechanical fixings, modular façades and standardized components to support future adaptability and maintenance.

5.7 Electrical & EV infrastructure
- Electrical infrastructure sized for future electrification. Recommend pre-provision for EV charging at each parking bay or centralised tenant charging with spare ducting and distribution capacity.
- Cost note: EV-ready parking pre-installation (conduits and spare capacity) is modest; full provision of 1:1 chargers adds significant cost per bay (~€2.5k–€6k per charger for wiring and installation; if 3-phase and metering required cost higher).

## 6. Accessibility, fire & statutory compliance

6.1 Accessibility targets
- Compliance: design to meet national and local accessibility regulations; consider DIN standards where applicable.
- Unit adaptations: provide at least 5% adaptable dwellings to MDS/Bauordnungen requirements (step-free access, reinforced WC walls, wheelchair circulation).
- Thresholds: threshold-free main entrances to building and accessible apartments with minimum door clearances and bathroom turning circles.

6.2 Fire safety overview (concept stage)
- Escape routes: central stair designed as protected staircase with adequate width and separation depending on occupant load. Travel distances to exits to meet local code.
- Compartmentation: typical residential compartment size to be determined with fire engineer. Fire-rated walls and floors at core interfaces and between apartments as required.
- Detection & alarming: provide automatic smoke detection in escape routes and common areas; dwellings to have heat/smoke alarms as per LBO/Feuerwehr requirements.
- Fire brigade access: ensure adequate external access for fire engines, hydrants and turning where required; location and sizing of external hydrant to be coordinated with local Feuerwehr.

6.3 Statutory considerations
- Energy compliance: GEG (Gebäudeenergiegesetz) compliance mandatory. Consider KfW funding levels for low energy buildings.
- Planning: the local Bebauungsplan (if present) will dictate building envelope, ridge heights, setbacks and permitted uses. Early engagement with planning authority recommended.
- Noise protection: where adjacent to highways or commercial uses, acoustic facade and glazing specification to address Lärmpegel per local regulations and DIN standards.

6.4 Accessibility & Safety checklist (concept)
- Accessible main entrance and lobby with level approach.
- Lift access to all residential floors and accessible flats on each floor.
- Adaptable bathrooms/en-suite reinforcement for future grab rail installation.
- Clear signage and emergency lighting in accordance with DIN/VDE standards.
- Fire stopping details for service penetrations and compartment interfaces.

## 8. Preliminary cost estimate — methodology, worked example & sensitivity analysis

8.1 Methodology
- Order of Magnitude estimate using unit-rate method (€ per m² GFA) for overall construction cost.
- Elemental percentage breakdown employed to allocate the construction cost to major work packages (structure, façade, MEP, finishes, external works, etc).
- Professional fees expressed as a percentage of construction cost and applied after subtotal of construction works.
- Contingency applied to reflect concept-level uncertainty (recommended 6–10%).

Assumptions for cost modelling
- Costs are based on typical mid-range building methods and finishes in Germany as of current market conditions.
- Exclusions: land acquisition, VAT, financing costs, statutory developer levies (if any), and specialist fit-out beyond standard options (such as bespoke kitchens, high-end appliances).
- All rates to be validated with a QS and contractors during RIBA Stage 2–3 (or equivalent).

8.2 Unit-rate guidance (typical mid-range Germany market)
- Indicative construction cost (incl. structure, envelope, MEP, interiors): €1,800 — €2,800 / m² (GFA)
  - Low: €1,800/m² — economy finishes, straightforward site.
  - Mid-range: €2,200/m² — typical selection used for example calculations below.
  - High: €2,800+/m² — premium finishes, complex site, basement parking.

8.3 Worked example (assumed GFA = 2,500 m²; unit rate €2,200/m²)
- Construction cost (shell + fit-out): 2,500 m² × €2,200 = €5,500,000

Elemental breakdown of construction cost (detailed)
| Element | % of construction cost | Value (€) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Substructure & foundations | 8% | 440,000 |
| Structure / frame (superstructure) | 30% | 1,650,000 |
| Façade & roof | 18% | 990,000 |
| Windows & external doors | 2% | 110,000 |
| Internal partitions & finishes | 15% | 825,000 |
| MEP (HVAC, plumbing, electrical, fire) | 18% | 990,000 |
| Kitchens & bathrooms (fittings) | 5% | 275,000 |
| Lifts & vertical transportation | 1% | 55,000 |
| External works & landscaping | 3% | 165,000 |
| Site works, temporary works & preliminaries | 5% | 275,000 |
| Total construction cost (subtotal) | 100% | 5,500,000 |

Notes:
- The above elemental splits have been refined from the initial high-level breakdown to include substructure and lifts separately.
- If basement parking is included, substructure & foundations and mechanical systems could rise significantly (see Section 9).

Professional fees & permits
- Professional fees (architecture, structural, MEP, QS, project management, specialist consultants): typical range 8–12% at concept/through to construction stage. We have used 10% for this example.
  - Professional fees (10%): €550,000

Contingency
- Recommended contingency at concept stage: 6–10%. We use 8% as a reasonable example.
  - Contingency (8% on construction subtotal): €440,000

Indicative project total (including fees & contingency)
- Subtotal construction: €5,500,000  
- + Professional fees: €550,000  
- + Contingency: €440,000  
- Indicative project total: €6,490,000

Exclusions: VAT and land acquisition are excluded from the above total.

8.4 Professional fee breakdown (recommended allocation)
| Discipline | % of construction cost | Value (€) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Architect (Awesome Inc.) | 5.0% | 275,000 |
| Structural Engineer | 1.2% | 66,000 |

| Specialist consultants (fire, acoustics, sustainability, accessibility) | 0.8% | 44,000 |
| Planning consultant / permit fees | 0.4% | 22,000 |
| Total (approx.) | 10.0% | 550,000 |

8.5 Cost sensitivity analysis
- +/- 10% change in unit rate:
  - At €1,980/m² (-10%): Construction cost = €4,950,000; total incl. fees & contingency ≈ €5,835,000
  - At €2,420/m² (+10%): Construction cost = €6,050,000; total incl. fees & contingency ≈ €7,145,000
- Site or scope risks that can drive costs up by 15–25% at concept stage:
  - Basement parking works, high groundwater requiring dewatering or pile foundations.
  - Significant retaining walls or underpinning of adjacent structures.
  - Complex façade systems or bespoke cladding.
  - Premium finishes and specialist fit-out.

8.6 Cost drivers & potential savings
Major cost drivers:
- Substructure (basement excavation, piling), façade complexity, MEP complexity and high-end finishes.
Cost saving strategies:
- Standardise apartment layouts and bathroom/kitchen modules.
- Use prefabricated bathroom pods or modular MEP risers where beneficial.
- Simplify façade detailing and reduce bespoke panel sizes.
- Early contractor involvement (ECI) to value engineer structural spans and material choices.

## 9. Example alternative scenarios (quick view & additional options)

9.1 Summary table — construction cost by finish level (GFA 2,500 m²)
| Scenario | Unit rate (€ / m²) | Construction cost (€) | Fees (10%) | Contingency (8%) | Indicative total (€) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Economy finish | 1,800 | 4,500,000 | 450,000 | 360,000 | 5,310,000 |
| Mid-range (base case) | 2,200 | 5,500,000 | 550,000 | 440,000 | 6,490,000 |
| Premium finish | 2,800 | 7,000,000 | 700,000 | 560,000 | 8,260,000 |
| Mid-range + basement parking (approx. +€450/m²) | 2,650 | 6,625,000 | 662,500 | 530,000 | 7,817,500 |

9.2 Basement parking sensitivity
- Approximate additional cost for full basement parking (per parking bay): €25,000–€45,000 per bay depending on depth, groundwater and mechanical ventilation requirements.
- For 12 basement spaces at €30,000 each: additional cost ~€360,000; this will increase substructure & MEP shares and may require additional plant.

9.3 Additional specialist items (examples & indicative pricing)
- PV rooftop system (10 kWp): €12,000–€20,000 (including inverters and mounting, excluding battery storage).
- Battery storage (10–20 kWh): €8,000–€18,000 depending on supplier and integration.
- Full EV charger installation per bay (with metering): €3,000–€8,000 per bay.
- MVHR per dwelling (including ducting): €1,200–€3,000 per unit depending on complexity.

Notes:
- Overlapping activities (structural/MEP design with concept stage) reduce time-to-tender and can reduce cost risk.
- Planning authority engagement and queries can extend the planning period; pre-application is recommended.
- Lead-in times for specialist items (e.g., bespoke façades, timber components) can be substantial and should be confirmed early.

Milestones & decision points (owner)
- Confirmation of budget envelope and parking strategy (Owner) — critical before detailed design.
- Confirmation of unit mix, target finishes and sustainability level (Owner) — informs MEP and façade decisions.
- Appointment of QS and lead contractor (Owner) — recommended before Stage 3 to reduce price volatility.

## 11. Assumptions, exclusions & risks

11.1 Key assumptions (recap)
- No abnormal ground conditions.
- No heritage restrictions or complicated demolition constraints.
- Typical local authority planning processes and timescales.
- Standard mid-range finishes and supplier availability.

11.2 Exclusions (not included in estimates)
- Land acquisition costs.
- VAT, financing and developer interest costs.
- Specialist tenant fit-outs beyond standard kitchens and bathrooms.
- Off-site remediation or unexpected contamination.
- Local developer contributions or levies (if applicable).
- Any statutory improvement costs demanded by local authority (e.g., highway works).

11.3 Risk register (concept-level)
| Risk | Probability (L/M/H) | Impact (L/M/H) | Mitigation | Contingency allowance |
|---|---:|---:|---|---:|
| Unexpected ground conditions requiring piling | M | H | Early geotechnical survey; allow piling options in design | 5–10% of substructure cost |
| Planning objections / extended authority review | M | M | Pre-application engagement; community consultation | Programme buffer |
| Market price inflation during tender | H | M–H | Early appointment of QS; ECI; fixed-price tender windows | 6–10% contingency |
| Scope creep / client changes to finishes | M | M | Clear scope freeze dates and design packages | 5% client change contingency |
| Specialist supply chain delays (façade / bespoke elements) | M | M | Early ordering & long-lead procurement | Programme buffer |
| Need for extensive basement or retaining works | L–M | H | Site topographical survey and geotech; design options | Additional budgeted sums (see Section 9) |

11.4 Contingency strategy
- Use tiered contingency:
  - Design contingency (6–8%) at concept for unknowns.
  - Tender contingency (contractor’s contingencies) for pricing errors or omissions.
  - Client change contingency (5%) to cover scope variations requested after tender.

---

## 12. Procurement & contract strategy

12.1 Recommended procurement route
- Preferred route: Traditional design-bid-build with early contractor involvement (ECI) at end of Stage 2 (concept) or tendering through two-stage negotiated tender with preferred contractor.
  - Rationale: ECI allows pricing of alternates, value engineering and programme forecasting while maintaining design control.
- Alternative: Design & Build (D&B) if client prefers single point responsibility and is prepared to trade some design control for price certainty.

12.2 Tender strategy
- Issue an initial pre-qualification (PQQ) to shortlist 4–6 contractors to ensure market interest and quality.
- Provide clear tender packages for subcontractor pricing (façade, MEP, internal finishes).
- Encourage contractors to submit alternative solutions that meet performance criteria (e.g., hybrid timber vs concrete) with cost & programme impacts.

12.3 Contract forms
- Recommended contractual form: FIDIC / VOB-B adapted to German practice or bespoke JCT-style form with clear payment milestones and variation control.
- For negotiated two-stage: Use agreements that allow early works to be priced and included into a firm GMP (guaranteed maximum price) once packages are fixed.

12.4 Procurement milestones & payments (example)
- RIBA Stage 2 (concept) completion: 10% of design fee milestone.
- Planning submission: 20% milestone.
- Tender issue and return: QS interim cost check and sign-off.
- Contractor appointment: mobilisation deposit (e.g., 5–10% of contract sum).
- Monthly valuations during works with retention (e.g., 5% retention until defects rectified).

## 13. Recommendations & next steps

Immediate actions (within 2–4 weeks)
1. Confirm project brief and core assumptions in Section 2:
   - Confirm GFA, target finishes, desired unit mix and parking strategy.
2. Commission site surveys:
   - Topographical survey, Batched utilities survey, Geotechnical investigation (Geotech Büro Mayer recommended).
3. Appoint core consultants:
   - Quantity Surveyor (Baukosten GmbH recommended for initial cost plan), Structural Engineer and MEP Engineer.
4. Undertake pre-application meeting with the local planning authority — obtain early advice on permitted massing and constraints.
5. If budget certainty is a priority, instruct QS to prepare an elemental cost plan and initiate contractor market sounding for two-stage procurement.

Meeting proposal (agenda)
- Duration: 60 minutes (in person or video).
- Attendees: Client decision-maker, Oscar (Awesome Inc.), QS representative, Geotech rep (optional), Planning contact (optional).
- Proposed agenda:
  1. Confirmation of site information and GFA (5 min).
  2. Review of proposed unit mix and target market (10 min).
  3. Parking strategy and local constraints (10 min).
  4. Sustainability targets and KfW aspirations (10 min).
  5. Cost envelope and acceptable risk (10 min).
  6. Next steps, responsibilities and timescale (10 min).
- Deliverables from meeting: agreed brief and a written meeting note with actions and timescales.

Longer-term recommendations
- Appoint QS prior to completing technical design to evolve the cost plan to elemental and trade-level pricing.
- Engage local planning authority early; consider a planning consultant if the site is complex.
- If exploring KfW grants or DGNB certification, agree targets now; early decisions on building fabric and services will materially affect costs and performance.

## 14. Appendices

Appendix A — Example area schedule (GFA = 2,500 m²; net/gross efficiency 78%)
- Gross Floor Area (GFA): 2,500 m²
- Net residential area (approx. GFA × 0.78): 1,950 m²
- Common areas, circulation & plant: 550 m² (22% of GFA)

Sample unit mix option (illustrative)
| Unit type | Unit size (m² net) | Quantity | Total net area (m²) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| 1BR (Type A) | 50 | 6 | 300 |
| 1BR (compact) | 45 | 4 | 180 |
| 2BR (Type B) | 75 | 8 | 600 |
| 2BR (larger) | 80 | 4 | 320 |
| 3BR (Type C) | 95 | 4 | 380 |
| Total apartments | — | 26 | 1,780 |

Notes:
- The above mix yields 26 units and totals 1,780 m² net apartments; the remaining net area (170 m²) could be allocated to storage, staff/common rooms, or slightly increased apartment sizes.
- If a higher average apartment size is desired, reduce unit count accordingly.

If you would like, I can:
- Convert the area schedule into a downloadable spreadsheet (CSV/XLSX) with unit-by-unit data.
