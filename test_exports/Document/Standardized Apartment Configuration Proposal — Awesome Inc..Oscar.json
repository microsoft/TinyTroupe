Cost estimate methodology, assumptions and detailed breakdown\n\nMethodology summary:\n- Costs are built up from GFA applied unit rates, adjusted by unit mix and type-specific fit-out allowances.\n- Prefab items (bathroom pods, kitchen modules) costed as manufactured product plus installation and interface works.\n- Soft costs applied as percentages of construction, with owner-level contingency applied after soft costs.\n- All figures are indicative baseline estimates for budgeting. A full QS should be prepared at the end of technical design.\n\nBaseline assumptions:\n- Representative building: GFA 1,200 m\u00b2\n- Construction unit cost: 2,600 EUR/m\u00b2 GFA (mid-range sustainable specification; includes prefab pods and performance envelope)\n- Construction cost total: 1,200 m\u00b2 * 2,600 EUR/m\u00b2 = 3,120,000 EUR\n\n7.1 Construction cost breakdown (detailed)\n\n| Cost category | % of construction | Amount (EUR) | Notes |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Substructure & shell (foundations, structure, envelope) | 45% | 1,404,000 | Includes external walls, windows, roof, structural frame |\n| Interiors & finishes (kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, doors) | 20% | 624,000 | Prefab pods and kitchen modules included here |\n| MEP (heating, ventilation, plumbing, electrics) | 20% | 624,000 | Includes plant, distribution and final fixings |\n| External works & landscaping | 5% | 156,000 | Access, paving, planting, cycle stores |\n| Site preliminaries & hoarding | 2% | 62,400 | Temporary works and onsite facilities |\n| Contractor contingency (on construction works) | 5% | 156,000 | Client to accept or adjust based on procurement |\n\nConstruction subtotal: 3,120,000 EUR\n\nSoft costs and owner-level items:\n\n| Soft cost item | % (or value) | Amount (EUR) | Notes |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Architecture & engineering fees (design + technical) | ~8% | 249,600 | Includes structural, MEP, coordination (owner: Oscar/design team) |\n| Permit fees, surveys, special consultants | ~3% | 93,600 | Geotech, fire, acoustic consultants |\n| Owner-level project contingency | 5% of total project | ~180,000 | Recommended for budget risk |\n| Client allowances & pre-sales marketing | allowance | 30,000 | Selection booklet, showflat fittings (estimate) |\n\nEstimated total project cost (construction + soft costs + contingencies):  \n3,120,000 + 249,600 + 93,600 + 180,000 + 30,000 = 3,673,200 EUR (rounded)\n\nBaseline per-unit average (20 units): ~183,660 EUR per unit (baseline)\n\n7.2 Unit-level cost allocation (sample)\nThis table shows a notional allocation of costs to unit types using area share and premium fit-out allowances.\n\n| Unit type | Qty | Net area (m\u00b2) | GFA (m\u00b2) | Share of GFA | Allocated cost (construction) |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Studio (35) | 4 | 35 | 161.0 | 13.42% | 3,120,000 * 0.1342 = 418,700 |\n| 1-BR (55) | 10 | 55 | 632.5 | 52.71% | 1,643,000 |\n| 2-BR (75) | 6 | 75 | 517.5 | 43.08% | 1,343,000 |\nTotal GFA allocated: 1,311 m\u00b2 (note: minor rounding due to conversion factors; allocation adjusted to total construction sum)\n\nAverage per unit (including soft costs pro rata):\n- Studios: approx. 418,700 / 4 = 104,675 EUR (construction share) + soft costs = ~135\u2013150k per studio depending on allocation.\n- 1-BR: 1,643,000 / 10 = 164,300 EUR (construction) + soft costs = ~200\u2013215k.\n- 2-BR: 1,343,000 / 6 = 223,833 EUR (construction) + soft costs = ~270\u2013290k.\n\nNote: These per-unit figures are indicative and will be refined with a full QS.\n\n7.3 Itemised allowances (examples)\n- Prefab bathroom pod (mid-range): 7\u201310 kEUR per pod (including fit and interface).\n- Kitchen module:\n  - Economy: 2.5\u20134 kEUR\n  - Standard: 4.5\u20137 kEUR\n  - Premium: 8\u201312 kEUR\n- Windows: 300\u2013450 EUR/m\u00b2 window area (triple-glazed mid-range)\n- MVHR unit: 1.5\u20133.0 kEUR per dwelling for compact units (plus ductwork and commissioning)\n- Heat pump (air-to-water) system allocation per building: 35\u201360 kEUR (plant and primary distribution).\n- PV system (rooftop, installed): 1,000\u20131,400 EUR/kWp depending on scale \u2014 a 10 kWp system ~10\u201314 kEUR.\n\n7.4 Contingency rationale\n- Contractor contingency (5%): covers unforeseen construction-level items.\n- Owner-level contingency (5% after soft costs): covers scope changes, escalation risk, finance or market-driven cost increases.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Sensitivity analysis and scenarios\n\nThis section quantifies impacts of key variations on baseline totals.\n\n8.1 Material/labour escalation\n- +/-10% on construction costs:\n  - +10%: construction becomes 3,432,000 EUR (+312,000)\n  - -10%: construction becomes 2,808,000 EUR (-312,000)\n\n8.2 Finish level variation (Economy \u2192 Premium)\n- Interiors & finishes line = 624,000 EUR baseline\n  - Economy package (reduce by 20%): -124,800 EUR\n  - Premium package (increase by 25\u201340%): +156,000\u2013249,600 EUR\n\n8.3 PV and Heat Pump adoption\n- Option A: PV-only modest (5\u201310 kWp): +5\u201314 kEUR upfront; payback depending on export/feed-in tariffs and self-consumption.\n- Option B: Full decarbonisation package (heat pump + MVHR + PV): +60\u2013120 kEUR upfront (as noted), with operating cost reduction estimates of 30\u201360% vs baseline gas-based approach \u2014 payback period typically 6\u201312 years depending on energy price trajectory and subsidies (e.g., KfW grants or BAFA incentives).\n\n8.4 Prefab pod premium vs conventional wet trades\n- Prefab premium (manufacture + transport + craning): 2\u20134 kEUR per pod premium vs site-built alternative, but saved on-site wet trade and reduced programme. Net benefit often appears when factoring reduced site time (labour savings) and lower snagging \u2014 estimated programme saving 6\u201310 weeks which reduces prelim costs and allows earlier rental income.\n\n8.5 Scenario matrix (summary)\n\n| Scenario | Construction cost change | Net effect on total project cost | Notes |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Base | 2,600 \u20ac/m\u00b2 | ~3.67M total | Baseline sustainable mid-range |\n| +10% materials/labour | +312k | ~3.99M | Escalation risk |\n| Premium finishes | +156\u2013250k | ~3.83\u20133.92M | Market upgrade |\n| Add full decarb package | +60\u2013120k | ~3.73\u20133.79M | Lifecycle benefits |\n| Economy finishes & partial PV | -125k + 10k | ~3.56M | Lower capex, higher Opex |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Lifecycle & operating considerations (LCCA) \u2014 extended\n\n9.1 Rationale\nInvestment in higher-performance building elements (windows, insulation, heat pump systems, PV) increases initial capex but reduces energy operating costs and potentially increases rental value and time-on-market. Lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) considers capital, energy, maintenance, and replacement over a defined period (e.g., 30 years).\n\n9.2 Simple LCCA example (illustrative)\nAssumptions:\n- Baseline heating system: gas boiler, annual energy cost per unit (for heating + hot water) = 1,200 EUR\n- Upgrade: heat pump + MVHR + PV reduces annual energy cost to 450 EUR (savings = 750 EUR per unit/year)\n- Additional capital cost per unit for upgrade: 3,000 EUR (share of building system)\n- Discount rate: 3%\n- Analysis period: 20 years\n\nNet present value (NPV) of energy savings per unit:\n- Annual savings 750 EUR, discounted at 3% over 20 years \u21d2 NPV \u2248 11,300 EUR\n- Payback: 3,000 / 750 \u2248 4 years simple payback\n\nConclusion (illustrative): For most mid-rise residential, investing in efficient systems has favourable payback when energy prices are moderate-high and subsidies apply.\n\n9.3 Maintenance & replacement allowances (recommended annual allowances)\n- Plant & equipment (heat pumps, MVHR): set aside 1.0\u20131.5% of initial plant capex annually for replacement/maintenance.\n- Exterior envelope: medium term maintenance (repointing, fa\u00e7ade cleaning) allowance every 25\u201330 years.\n- Finishes (flooring, kitchens): kitchens expected life 15\u201320 years; allowances for upgrades/replacements recommended.\n\n9.4 Warranty & aftercare\n- Typical contractor defects period: 12 months plus longer structural or waterproofing guarantees as negotiated (e.g., 5\u201310 years for certain items).\n- Prefab modules: supplier warranties often 2\u20135 years for specific elements; ensure handover packs and assignment of warranties in contract.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Programme & milestones (detailed)\n\nHigh-level timeline for repeatable product rollout and a representative project (weeks and months provided as typical ranges).\n\n10.1 Product rollout (repeatable product catalogue)\n- Concept finalisation & product catalogue: 2\u20134 weeks \u2014 Owner: Oscar (design lead) with Anna for finishes.\n- Prototyping & mock-up (prefab pod and fa\u00e7ade detail): 4\u20136 weeks \u2014 Owner: Richard & manufacturer lead.\n- Finalise standard element specs and procurement template: 2 weeks \u2014 Procurement & John.\n- Marketing & pre-sales package production: 3 weeks \u2014 Anna & marketing team.\n- Pilot build or demonstration unit (optional): 12\u201316 weeks.\n\n10.2 Representative project schedule (from concept to handover)\n- Phase 0: Project mobilisation & site due diligence (4 weeks)\n- Phase 1: Concept design & product selection (2\u20134 weeks) \u2014 deliverable: finalized unit plans and finish selection booklet.\n- Phase 2: Technical design & coordination (6\u20138 weeks) \u2014 structural, MEP and prefab coordination BIM models.\n- Phase 3: Permit submission & approvals (8\u201312 weeks) \u2014 may run in parallel with late technical design.\n- Phase 4: Tender & contractor selection (4\u20136 weeks)\n- Phase 5: Site mobilisation & foundation works (8\u201310 weeks) \u2014 depends on groundworks complexity.\n- Phase 6: Superstructure, enclosure & prefabrication installation (20\u201330 weeks) \u2014 includes craning of pods and fa\u00e7ade panels.\n- Phase 7: Internal finishes, commissioning & snagging (8\u201312 weeks)\n- Phase 8: Handover & defects liability start (4 weeks)\n\nConstruction typical duration: 12 months from mobilisation to practical completion for this building footprint with prefabrication.\n\n10.3 Critical path (summary)\n- Long lead items: prefabricated pods and fa\u00e7ade components \u2014 early procurement and design freeze required.\n- Permit approvals: early engagement with authorities strongly recommended to avoid delays.\n- Structural and MEP coordination: clash detection and interface resolution via BIM essential.\n\n10.4 Detailed Gantt-style (weeks) \u2014 indicative\n\n| Activity | Weeks (indicative) |\n|---|---:|\n| Mobilisation & surveys | 0\u20134 |\n| Concept design & selection | 2\u20136 |\n| Tech design & coordination (BIM) | 6\u201314 |\n| Permit submission | 10\u201322 |\n| Tendering & contractor appointment | 16\u201322 |\n| Site mobilisation & foundations | 22\u201332 |\n| Superstructure & enclosure (incl. pods) | 32\u201356 |\n| Interiors & finishes | 48\u201364 |\n| Commissioning & Handover | 64\u201368 |\n\nNote: Overlaps indicated.

Risks & mitigation register (detailed)\n\n| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|---|---:|---:|---|\n| Cost escalation (materials/labour) | High | Medium-High | Early contracting, fixed-price tenders, contingency, bulk procurement for modules |\n| Permit delays | Medium-High | Medium | Pre-application meetings with planning authority, early engagement and complete submission |\n| Prefab integration interface issues | Medium | Medium | BIM coordination, early supplier involvement (ESI), mock-up assembly, tolerance schedule |\n| Quality issues from suppliers | Medium | Low-Medium | Factory acceptance tests, supplier pre-qualification, staged payments tied to FAT |\n| Ground conditions / unforeseen geotech findings | High | Low-Medium | Site investigations early, contingency allowance and clause in contracts |\n| Construction accidents / H&S incidents | High | Low | Robust site safety plan, contractor H&S prequalification, supervision |\n| Market demand shifts (sales/rentability) | Medium | Medium | Market testing, flex floor-plate for conversion to rental or sale configurations |\n| Supply chain disruption (appliances, tiles) | Medium | Medium | Alternative approved suppliers, early ordering for long-lead items |\n\n---\n\n## 12. Procurement and contract strategy\n\nRecommended procurement routes:\n- Two-stage design & build with early contractor involvement (ECI):\n  - Benefits: contractor engaged early, input on buildability and prefab installation, potential cost certainty on stage two.\n- Alternatively, design-bid-build with prefabrication packages tendered to specialist suppliers:\n  - For high competition on modules and clear technical specs.\n- Contract forms: FIDIC short form or standard German VOB/B contracts as appropriate \u2014 legal counsel to advise.\n\nProcurement recommendations:\n- Pre-qualify manufacturers for bathroom pods and kitchen modules (evaluate references, factory capacity, QA systems, warranty terms).\n- Tender in packages: main contractor, prefab pod supplier, fa\u00e7ade supplier, windows, MEP subcontractors \u2014 coordinate interfaces in tender documents.\n- Include performance-based specifications where possible (e.g., acoustic outcomes and energy performance targets) rather than overly prescriptive material lists.\n\nPayment & risk allocation:\n- Split payments for prefabricated modules between factory stage acceptance, delivery to site, and final installation sign-off.\n- Liability and warranty periods clearly defined, with retention to ensure defect correction.\n\nTender package contents (summary \u2014 full list in Appendix):\n- Drawings: dimensioned plans, elevations, sections, typical details\n- Specification: performance-based and prescriptive items\n- BIM models and interface schedules\n- Bill of Quantities (BoQ) / activity schedule\n- Site constraints and logistics requirements\n- Programme and payment schedule\n\n---\n\n## 13. Deliverables, acceptance criteria and governance\n\nDeliverables:\n- Detailed unit plans and elevations (CAD and PDF).\n- Standard elements catalogue (product datasheets and finish boards).\n- BIM coordination model with MEP riser positions and pod interface points.\n- Technical specification and tender package.\n- Selection booklet for clients with finish boards and indicative costs.\n- Commissioning plans and O&M manual templates for all systems.\n\nAcceptance criteria (examples):\n- Units finished to the selected finish pack without defects listed on handover SNAG list.\n- All MEP systems operating per design parameters and commissioned (including MVHR balancing, heat pump testing, PV commissioning).\n- Air tightness and acoustic tests performed and results meet contract thresholds.\n- Fire and safety systems installed and accepted by local authorities.\n\nGovernance:\n- Project board to include: Owner (client rep), Design lead (Oscar), Project manager (John), Structural consultant (Richard), Finishes lead (Anna), Procurement lead.\n- Monthly design review and fortnightly coordination with contractor once appointed.\n- Escalation path for design changes and budget approvals defined (e.g., anything >5% budget impact requires board sign-off).\n\n---\n\n## 14. Recommendations (prioritised \u2014 expanded)\n1. Adopt prefab bathroom pods and kitchen modules to speed construction, improve quality control, and reduce on-site wet trades. Prioritise early supplier engagement and a full mock-up.\n2. Standardize three finish packages (Economy / Standard / Premium) with clear price deltas and visual sample boards. Anna to develop finish boards, sample boxes and client selection booklet for decision-making sessions.\n3. Invest in a high-performance window specification and compact MVHR system where possible \u2014 these yield the best value in reducing energy demand and improving acoustics.\n4. Use the baseline cost model for early budgeting but require a detailed quantity survey (QS) at the end of technical design; John should sign off on contingency levels before tender.\n5. Provide at least one accessible or wheelchair-adaptable unit on the entrance level as standard to meet DIN 18040 expectations and broaden marketability.\n6. Conduct early meetings with local Feuerpolizei to align fire strategy and avoid costly reworks at permit stage.\n7. Undertake a mock-up of a bathroom pod and one typical apartment to test interfaces, finishes and client selections \u2014 set aside a prototype budget.\n\n---\n\n## 15.
