## Author
Oscar (Lead Architect, Awesome Inc.)

## Executive summary
This document presents a detailed architectural and cost-feasibility proposal for a standardized apartment building product that Awesome Inc. can offer to clients as a pre-defined, configurable building type. The proposal expands the concept from a high-level outline into a comprehensive package that includes:

- A refined design concept and spatial strategy emphasizing functionality, durability and energy efficiency.
- A detailed representative unit mix, area schedule and illustrative unit descriptions.
- Standard elements, tiered options and a fully expanded specification matrix for procurement.
- Structural, MEP and sustainability targets with suggested performance criteria and typical component selections.
- A more detailed preliminary cost model with line-item breakdowns, sensitivity scenarios and lifecycle (operational cost) indications.
- A procurement and delivery strategy with recommended contract forms, quality assurance measures and a risk register.
- A phased project timeline with delivery milestones, decision points and responsibilities.
- Next-step actions, deliverables and practical checklists for moving to pre-tender and tender stages.

Numbers included are conceptual early-stage estimates intended to establish feasibility and guide decisions. Typical expected accuracy at this stage: +/- 10–15%. These should be refined by site-specific investigations and a cost consultant prior to tender.

## Project objectives (expanded)
Primary objectives
- Deliver a repeatable, high-quality apartment typology clients can select with minimal bespoke design time, enabling rapid deployment across multiple sites.
- Prioritize durability, low operational energy demand and straightforward maintainability to reduce lifecycle costs and enhance marketability.
- Maintain a modular palette of materials and finishes with a limited number of configurable options to accelerate procurement and control cost variability.
- Ensure basic compliance with applicable German residential regulations and accessibility standards, with the understanding that local authority requirements will be confirmed at permit stage.

Secondary objectives
- Reduce embodied carbon where cost-effective by offering a timber-concrete hybrid upper floor option and specifying low-carbon materials.
- Achieve a balance between initial capital cost and lifecycle operating cost—promote investments in fabric and systems that reduce tenant energy costs.
- Create a product that can be marketed to mid-market buyers and long-term renters, with optional premium finishes packages for PRS (Private Rented Sector) or for-sale units.

Success criteria
- Cost: Achieve competitive installed cost per m2 within the ranges identified in the preliminary estimates.
- Performance: Target operational heating demand ≤ 45–60 kWh/m2·a (illustrative, depending on final envelope and system choices) and balanced ventilation with heat recovery.
- Accessibility: At least one fully wheelchair-accessible unit on the ground floor and accessible common entries.
- Delivery: Design development to 60% and permitting milestones met within the projected schedule (see Milestones section).

## Key assumptions (explicit, expanded)
- Gross floor area (GFA): 1,200 m2 (typical 3–4 storey mid-rise building). This GFA includes grossed circulation and common areas.
- Net lettable/sale area (NLA): typically ~72–78% of GFA depending on corridor, core and plant room area. For our representative mix NLA ~880–940 m2.
- Unit count: 12 units (example mix specified below). Unit mix and sizes can be adjusted by the client.
- Typical floor to floor height: 2.7–3.0 m depending on mechanical stacking requirements and local planning height allowances.
- Service cores: single central stair and lift core serving all floors; location assumes long-side access corridor to maximize cross-ventilation where possible.
- Target market: German mid-market buyers or long-term renters. Fit-out standards oriented to “mid-range” finishes as base-case; premium tier available.
- Geotechnical, utility connection and planning constraints: unknown at this stage; may materially affect foundation cost, basement vs slab-on-grade decisions and external works.
- Cost basis: prices in EUR and are net unless specified; VAT assumed at 19% for final totals. Excludes land acquisition, major off-site infrastructure, demolition or remediation costs unless stated.
- Time and market: cost estimates are early-stage and subject to commodity price volatility, labour availability and regional market differences.
- Energy and carbon: operational energy figures are illustrative target values; final performance will require detailed energy modelling.

## Design concept (expanded)
Design philosophy
- A clean modernist volume with simple roof geometry (either a shallow pitched roof or a shallow flat roof with parapet and single-plane slope) to reduce construction complexity and roof detailing costs.
- Compact circulation: minimize wasted corridor area through efficient stacking and core placement. Target gross-to-net efficiency (NLA/GFA) of ~0.75–0.80.
- Cross-ventilated and well-daylit units where the site orientation allows. Primary living spaces face south or east-west wherever possible.
- Private outdoor space: balconies or loggias for primary living rooms on two-bedroom and three-bedroom units. Balcony depth typical 1.4m for usability, balustrade minimum 1.1m height.
- Durable façade: prefabricated insulated panels or ventilated rainscreen with fibre-cement or composite panels to optimize construction speed and reduce on-site labour.
- Standardized service modules (kitchens/bathrooms) for procurement and repeatability; bathroom pod option for faster fit-out and predictable MEP interfaces.
- Simple, legible structural grid (e.g., 6.0m x 4.5m or similar) that supports flexible internal partitions and maximizes repeatability of unit layouts.

Spatial strategy (typical floor)
- Ground floor: accessible entry lobby, mail/parcel room, plant room, bike store and one accessible flat (or adaptable unit), utilities and waste collection area. Small external amenity (private or shared courtyard).
- Upper floors: mix of 1-, 2- and 3-bedroom flats arranged around a central corridor/stair core. Max unit depth targeted ~8–9m to ensure daylight to living spaces.
- Circulation: single stair + lift providing evacuation and accessibility; stair designed to meet local fire egress standards (with half-landing widths and handrails according to DIN guidance).
- Vertical services: central riser zone close to the core for stacked plumbing and ventilation runs; electrical distribution designed for individual apartment metering.

Aesthetic intent
- Simple volume with restrained detailing; balconies as subtle horizontal elements for composition.
- Material palette: neutral mineral render or timber composite panels as accents; anodized aluminum window frames in muted tones. Emphasis on low-maintenance finishes.

## Standard elements & options catalogue (expanded)
This section provides a standardized element catalogue for structural, envelope, internal finishes and systems. For procurement, elements are grouped into Base (Value), Standard (Base-case), and Premium (Up-sell) tiers.

1. Structural systems
   - Option A — Reinforced concrete frame (Base-case)
     - Cast-in-place RC slabs and beams, reinforced columns. Standard slab thickness: 200–220 mm for solid slabs; flat slab or ribbed slab options depending on span.
     - Strengths: robust, familiar to local contractors, good fire resistance.
     - Considerations: higher embodied carbon and longer wet trades duration.
   - Option B — Timber-concrete hybrid (Value & Sustainability option)
     - CLT or glulam for floors and upper walls with thin concrete topping for acoustic and service runs.
     - Strengths: reduced embodied carbon, faster erection, lighter foundations.
     - Considerations: acoustic detailing, fire treatment and local contractor capability.

2. Façade systems
   - Base: Insulated mineral render over breathable insulation board on a masonry backup or insulated prefabricated panel.
   - Standard: Prefabricated insulated rainscreen panels with fibre-cement outer boards (concealed fixings). Thermal spacer details to minimize thermal bridging.
   - Premium: Prefinished metal or natural timber rainscreen accents with higher-grade fastenings and integrated LED lighting features for balcony soffits.

3. Windows & external doors
   - Base: PVC triple-glazed units Uwindow ≈ 1.2 W/m2K (budget), standard high-performance: aluminum-clad timber or thermally-broken aluminum with triple glazing Uwindow ≈ 0.9–1.0 W/m2K.
   - Thermal breaks and continuous perimeter seals mandatory. Limiting solar gain via externally mounted shading where required.

4. Kitchens & bathrooms (module approach)
   - Three-tier finishes: Basic, Standard, Premium.
   - Standard module sizes: 2.4m, 3.0m and 3.6m linear kitchens; bathroom pods typical 2.2m x 2.4m module for 1BR/2BR.
   - Plumbing manifolds and stacking to be coordinated with service riser locations.

5. HVAC & ventilation
   - Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) by default for energy efficiency; efficiency target sensible heat recovery >75% in standard model, >85% in premium.
   - Heating/hot water: Building-level heat pump (air-source) with plate heat exchangers to apartment distribution, or individual heat-pump-at-apartment as a lower-cost distributed option.
   - Domestic hot water: centralized instantaneously sized heat pump or buffer storage depending on tenant demand profile.
   - Optional: GSHP (ground-source heat pump) where ground conditions favourable and CAPEX can be justified.

6. Renewable energy
   - PV-ready roof with structural allowance for arrays: roof area allowance to mount up to 30–50 kWp depending on area and orientation (typical 15–25 m2 per kWp required depending on module efficiency and tilt).
   - Battery storage optional for common-area backup and load-shifting.

7. Accessibility & fire safety
   - Minimum 1 wheelchair-accessible unit (ground-floor or lift-served), accessible main entry route, door widths min 0.9 m, corridor width min 1.2 m in accessible routes.
   - Fire-safety systems to meet local code: smoke detection, emergency lighting and fire-separating construction as required.

8. Internal finishes (example)
   - Floors: vinyl plank in wet areas (basic), engineered timber or high-grade LVT in living (standard), solid wood or premium LVT (premium).
   - Walls: washable paint (standard), porcelain tiles in bathrooms up to 2.2 m (standard), full-height tiles or natural stone (premium).
   - Joinery: flat-pack or built-in wardrobes tuned to tier.

9. Landscape & external works
   - Base: permeable paving, basic tree planting and minimal levels modification.
   - Standard: designed planting beds, seating, communal amenity path, secure bike parking for 1.5–2 bikes per unit.
   - Premium: landscaped courtyard with seasonal planting, rain gardens and individual garden plots for ground-floor units.

---

## Sustainability & energy strategy (expanded)
Overall approach
- Fabric-first philosophy: prioritize insulation and airtightness to reduce heating demand and system size. Target airtightness n50 = 1.0–1.5 h^-1 for base-case, 0.6–1.0 h^-1 for premium.
- Building Envelope Target U-values (indicative targets for mid-market, adjust for local code):
  - External walls: 0.18–0.20 W/m2K (standard); 0.12–0.15 W/m2K (premium)
  - Roof: 0.12–0.15 W/m2K
  - Ground slab: 0.15–0.20 W/m2K with edge insulation
  - Windows (triple-glazed): 0.9–1.1 W/m2K
- Mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) to ensure fresh air and reduce heating loads. Target system COP equivalent for heat pumps > 3.0 (seasonal performance factor SPFs 2.5–3.5 depending on system).
- Heat pump technology: air-source heat pumps as standard; ground-source (vertical or horizontal) as premium option if ground conditions and budget permit.
- Solar PV: size arrays to offset common area and some tenant electricity usage where feasible; integrate with tenant billing and potential for feed-in revenue where permitted.
- Embodied carbon considerations: assess timber-concrete hybrid option vs full reinforced concrete in a life-cycle analysis (LCA) during design development.

Performance targets (illustrative)
- Space heating demand: aim for 40–60 kWh/m2·a (representative depending on final envelope), or better with premium insulation.
- Primary energy demand: design to meet GEG requirements; coordinate with energy consultant for exact targets and local compliance pathways.

Operational benefits
- Lower utility costs for tenants, which is attractive for PRS and for-sale markets.
- Potential for sustainability certification (e.g., DGNB or equivalent) if client chooses the premium path.

---

## Compliance & accessibility (expanded)
Regulatory references and process
- High level: Compliance with German national and local building regulations is required. At minimum, the design will be checked against:
  - Gebäudeenergiegesetz (GEG) — energy performance.
  - DIN standards covering accessibility and planning (e.g., DIN 18040 for barrier-free building) — verify version/current standards in each local authority.
  - Local fire safety requirements, which may reference Musterbauordnung (MBO) and local fire authority amendments.
  - Local planning and zoning rules: setbacks, height limits, parking provisions and landscaping requirements.
- Accessibility: one fully accessible/visitable apartment recommended on ground floor or lift-served floor with step-free access to entrances and common amenity spaces. Typical accessibility checklist:
  - Entry threshold: step-free and level (max crossfall 1:50).
  - Door clear width: 900 mm minimum for accessible doors.
  - Turning circle in living/kitchen or bedroom: 1500 mm diameter.
  - Bathroom: clear maneuvering space and reinforced walls for potential grab rails.
  - Lift: internal dimensions 1100 x 1400 mm (or as required by local standards) to allow stretcher access where required.

---

## Structural and MEP outline (early-stage, expanded)
Structural outline
- Grid and spans: adopt a regular grid (e.g., 6.0m x 4.5m) enabling simple panel dimensions and repeatable floor plates. Minimize non-repetitive elements to reduce carpenter and formwork complexity.
- Foundations: shallow strip or pad foundations assumed for competent ground; piled foundations to be budgeted as a risk if poor soils are found.
- Lateral stability: shear walls or diaphragms as required; coordinate with structural engineer for seismic or wind load requirements if needed.

MEP outline
- Central plant room sized for heat-pump, MVHR unit, DHW tanks and electrical distribution. Allow for future PV inverter location.
- Hot water distribution: insulated manifold system for each apartment or centralized DHW with circulated loops depending on design choice and energy efficiency cost trade-offs.
- Electrical: individual apartment metering; consider pre-wiring for EV chargers in allocated bike/parking areas.
- Data & comms: provision for high-speed data backbone and shared Wi-Fi in common areas; pre-wire living spaces for flexible tenant need.
- Acoustic: floor build-ups and separating wall partitions designed to meet local sound insulation requirements (R’w 50–55dB airborne; impact sound reduction L’nT,w to meet Code). Increased acoustic performance in premium or where local requirements exceed typical.

## Preliminary cost estimate (base-case and value-engineered alternative) — expanded
Refined assumptions: GFA 1,200 m2; 12 units; Base-case mid-range finishes. All costs exclusive of land acquisition.

A. Base-case (mid-range finishes) — detailed breakdown
- Construction cost (building shell + interior fit-out + services): 1,200 m2 x €2,400/m2 = €2,880,000
  - Shell & structure: 45% = €1,296,000
  - Interior fit-out & finishes: 20% = €576,000
  - Building services (HVAC, electrical, plumbing): 18% = €518,400
  - Other works included in construction cost (balconies, windows, doors, internal partitions, stair and lift): included above
- External works & landscaping: €150,000
- Professional fees (architect, structural, MEP, permit, specialists): 10% of construction cost = €288,000
- Permits and statutory fees (included within professional or as separate allowance): €50,000 (allowance, site dependent)
- Contingency (7% of construction + external works): 0.07 x (€2,880,000 + €150,000) = €212,100
- Subtotal before VAT: €3,538,100 (inc. permit allowance)
- VAT (19%): €672,238
- Total (incl. VAT): €4,210,338
- Approx. total incl VAT per m2 (GFA): €3,509/m2
- Per-unit cost (12 units): approx. €350,861 per unit (incl. VAT)

Notes:
- Slight differences from previous totals due to added permit allowance and rounding.
- Construction cost per m2 includes core & shell, fit-out and services as noted.

B. Value-engineered scenario (cost focus)
- Construction cost: 1,200 m2 x €2,000/m2 = €2,400,000
  - Adjusted percentages reflecting lower-spec finishes and simpler façade
- External works & landscaping: €120,000
- Professional fees (10% of construction cost): €240,000
- Permits and statutory fees allowance: €40,000
- Contingency (7%): 0.07 x (€2,400,000 + €120,000) = €176,400
- Subtotal before VAT: €2,876,400
- VAT (19%): €546,516
- Total (incl. VAT): €3,422,916
- Approx. per m2 (GFA): €2,856/m2
- Per-unit cost: approx. €285,243 per unit (incl. VAT)

C. Sensitivity and escalation allowance
- Market volatility: Include an escalation allowance of 3–6% if tender expected beyond 6–9 months.
- Commodity risk: If steel or timber prices increase by 10% this could add ~2–3% to construction cost depending on structural choice.

D. Cost breakdown table (base-case illustrative)

| Category | % of construction | € (approx) |
|---|---:|---:|
| Shell & structure | 45% | 1,296,000 |
| Interior fit-out & finishes | 20% | 576,000 |
| Building services (HVAC, electrical, plumbing) | 18% | 518,400 |
| External works & landscaping | 4% | 150,000 |
| Professional fees & permits | 8% | 338,000 (including permit allowance) |
| Contingency & allowances | 5% | 212,100 |
| Subtotal (before VAT) | 100% | 3,090,500* |
| VAT (19%) | | 587,195 |
| Total incl VAT | | 3,677,695 |

*NOTE: Table illustrative — see A above for the full reconciliation.

E. Lifecycle cost (LCC) note (operational savings illustration)
- If the premium envelope reduces heating demand by 20 kWh/m2·a relative to base-case (e.g., from 60 to 40 kWh/m2·a), for a typical energy price of €0.12/kWh this equates to ~€2,880/year saved across all units (1,200 m2 × 20 kWh × €0.12). Over a 25-year period (discounting not applied here), the operational savings become material and can justify additional upfront investment depending on financing and occupant type.

---

## Cost breakdown by category (approximate split, base-case) — expanded and reconciled
- Shell & structure: 45% (~€1,296,000)
  - Foundations, structural frame, roof, external envelope
- Interior fit-out & finishes: 20% (~€576,000)
  - Floors, bathrooms, kitchens, doors, built-in joinery
- Building services (HVAC, electrical, plumbing): 18% (~€518,400)
  - MVHR, heat pump, hot water plant, apartment distribution, EV/lighting allowances
- External works & landscaping: 4% (~€150,000)
  - Paving, planting, bike store, boundary treatments
- Professional fees & permits: 8% (~€288,000)
  - Architect, structural, MEP, QS, specialist surveys allowances
- Contingency and allowances: 5% (~€212,100)
  - Unforeseen site conditions, minor scope adjustments

These splits are indicative and will be updated after tender returns.

## Value-engineering opportunities (detailed)
Primary cost reduction strategies (to achieve value-engineered scenario or better)
1. Façade simplification
   - Replace premium rainscreen panels with a more standard insulated render system or simple fibre-cement rainscreen without bespoke details. Savings: up to 6–10% of façade cost depending on scope.
2. Standardized modules
   - Use repeated kitchen and bathroom pod dimensions across units to reduce bespoke joinery and plumbing variations. Savings: 3–6% on fit-out.
3. Windows optimization
   - Use thermally-broken aluminum with double or lower-spec triple glazing balancing U-value and cost; tune solar gain via shading. Savings: 2–4% of total building cost.
4. Structural efficiency
   - Optimize grid and beam sizes, reduce cantilevers and bespoke transfer beams. Savings: 2–5% of structural cost.
5. Procurement route
   - Tender as design-and-build or select a contractor via partner frameworks to capture contractor efficiencies and price certainty. Potential to reduce overall cost and reduce contingency needs.
6. Reduce change orders
   - Early coordination of services, avoid late client-driven finish changes, and standardize selections to minimize variations during construction.

Trade-offs
- Lower initial CAPEX may increase operational costs, reduce market appeal for eco-conscious buyers and increase future retrofit costs. Value-engineering must be balanced against lifecycle and market objectives.

---

## Procurement & contract strategy (expanded)
Options
1. Traditional design–bid–build (DBB)
   - Pros: Clear separation of design and construction, typically good design control.
   - Cons: Contractor pricing risk; slower and may result in higher cost contingency.
   - Recommended when design clarity and control is paramount.

2. Design-and-build (D&B) / Contractor-led
   - Pros: Single point responsibility, potential cost and programme certainty, contractor innovation on buildability.
   - Cons: Reduced design control; requires robust employer’s requirements and careful tender documents.
   - Recommended for repeatable product where time-to-market and cost certainty are priorities.

3. Early contractor involvement (ECI) or alliancing
   - Pros: Collaborative risk-sharing, early cost input, better constructability integration.
   - Cons: Complex contract arrangements and potential cost for advisor management.

Contract forms to consider: FIDIC-lite, German VOB-based D&B contract or bespoke forms depending on procurement jurisdiction and client preferences.

Payment milestones (typical)
- Mobilization: 5% on contract signing
- Foundations completed: 15%
- Superstructure topped out: 30%
- External envelope watertight: 20%
- Practical completion: 25% (less retention)
- Retention: 3–5% released following defects period

Tendering duration: Allow 4–6 weeks for tender issue + 4–6 weeks for evaluation and appointment.

## Risks & contingencies (expanded with matrix)
Top project risks (high-level risk matrix with mitigation strategies):

1. Site unknowns (geotechnical) — High
   - Impact: Foundation redesign, increased cost and programme delays.
   - Mitigation: Commission early geotechnical survey; include scope for piled foundations in initial budget as allowance.

2. Market price volatility — Medium–High
   - Impact: Increases to material and labour costs.
   - Mitigation: Consider early procurement packages, fixed-price subcontractor bundles, and contract escalation clauses.

3. Permit & planning delays — Medium
   - Impact: Programme delay and cost escalation.
   - Mitigation: Early pre-application engagement with planning authority, use of model images and massing studies for quick feedback.

4. MEP complexity & stacking issues — Medium
   - Impact: Rework to ceiling/floor distribution and increased costs.
   - Mitigation: Early MEP coordination, standardized riser locations and compact plant room design.

5. Contractor capacity / labour shortages — Medium
   - Impact: Extended programme, higher cost.
   - Mitigation: Tender to multiple contractors, include local/regional contractors in tender list, consider phased delivery.

6. Acoustic/fire requirements beyond standard — Low–Medium
   - Impact: Increased wall/floor build-up cost and potential redesign.
   - Mitigation: Confirm statutory requirements early and design to exceed minimum where possible to avoid later retrofit.

Contingency recommendation
- Base-case: 7–10% contingency recommended at early stage; reduce after 60% design and fixed-price tender.
- Value-engineered scenario: still carry 5–7% contingency to provide buffer against world commodity movement and site surprises.
