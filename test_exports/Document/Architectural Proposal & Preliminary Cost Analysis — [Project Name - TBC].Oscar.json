Executive summary\nThis document presents a concept-level architectural proposal and indicative budget for the design and delivery of a new apartment building on an urban infill site in Germany. It provides:\n\n- A design approach that balances efficiency, daylight, privacy and buildability.\n- A sample unit mix and typical apartment sizes to demonstrate yield and circulation efficiency.\n- A comprehensive preliminary cost estimate (Order of Magnitude) including worked calculations based on a representative Gross Floor Area (GFA) of 2,500 m\u00b2 using a mid-range unit rate of \u20ac2,200/m\u00b2.\n- A breakdown of construction cost elements, professional fees, and contingency with sensitivity analysis.\n- Sustainability options and recommendations (energy target, MVHR, heat-pump systems and potential eligibility for KfW support).\n- A detailed preliminary schedule with recommended milestones and responsible parties.\n- A risk register and procurement recommendations to reduce budget and programme uncertainty.\n\nAll figures here are indicative. Final budgets and programme depend on confirmed site constraints, statutory requirements, structural and MEP design, contractor pricing, and tender results.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Project assumptions (please confirm)\nThe following assumptions underpin the concept design and cost estimates. Please review and confirm or amend these to refine subsequent design and cost work.\n\nKey assumptions\n- Site: urban infill site in Germany; exact address and site constraints to be provided. Typical urban plot with 18\u201325 m street frontage and 30\u201340 m depth assumed for massing studies.\n- GFA (assumed for worked example): 2,500 m\u00b2. Replace with confirmed GFA as soon as available.\n- Net/Gross efficiency target: 75\u201380% (we use 78% for worked examples where needed).\n- Typical building height: 4\u20137 storeys (mid-rise), depending on local plan and context.\n- Number of apartments: design examples use a range of 16\u201328 units depending on unit mix and average sizes.\n- Target standard: mid-range / high-quality finishes (durable, low-maintenance, energy-efficient). Premium and economy finishes are also modelled in alternative scenarios.\n- Parking: assumption is mixed, with some surface or underground parking; default scenario excludes extensive basement parking. Basement/underground parking will materially affect cost and programme.\n- Authorities approvals: local building permit (Bauantrag) and national energy code compliance (GEG). Other approvals may include local planning (Bebauungsplan), heritage (if applicable), and fire authority (Feuerwehr).\n- Unit services: stacked service risers and central cores to maintain efficiency and reduce MEP routing costs.\n- Geotechnical conditions: assumed typical for an urban German site (no extreme contamination, groundwater or rock). Actual soil conditions to be confirmed by geotechnical survey.\n\nPlease confirm or update these items to allow refinement of cost and design.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Project objectives\nPrimary objectives\n- Deliver a well-proportioned residential building providing flexible apartment types (1\u20133 bedroom mix) that respond to market demand and developer targets.\n- Maximise net usable residential area per GFA while ensuring comfortable layouts, daylight and cross-ventilation where possible.\n- Prioritise long-term value through robust detailing, durable materials, and energy-efficient building services.\n- Standardise repetitive elements (kitchens, bathrooms, internal doors, window sizes) to reduce variation and construction cost, while providing a limited palette of upgrade options for buyers/tenants.\n- Ensure compliance with applicable building regulations and deliver adaptable and accessible units (aspiring to at least 5% adaptable units).\n- Incorporate sustainability measures that reduce operational energy and carbon; explore funding routes (KfW) that incentivise energy performance.\n\nSecondary objectives\n- Maintain a buildable concept that minimises temporary works and complex structural solutions.\n- Achieve a cost plan with transparent contingencies and professional fees to support developer decision-making.\n- Provide procurement and delivery recommendations to reduce cost and programme risk.\n\nKey performance indicators (KPIs) proposed for project evaluation\n- Net/gross efficiency target: 75\u201380% (goal 78%).\n- Average apartment size target: 60\u201385 m\u00b2 (dependent on market).\n- Heating demand target: < 40 kWh/m\u00b2a (for KfW 55 target; lower targets for higher KfW levels).\n- Embodied carbon consideration: explore hybrid timber-concrete approach to reduce embodied carbon by up to ~15\u201325% versus full concrete for superstructure (subject to detailed assessment).\n- Cost target (construction): indicative mid-range \u20ac2,200/m\u00b2 (GFA). Developer to confirm budget tolerance.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Concept design approach\n\n4.1 Massing & urban strategy\n- Proposed approach: compact rectangular/orthogonal mass to optimise plan efficiency and structural regularity. Massing to respond to street alignment and neighbouring building heights.\n- Building setbacks and transition zones: provide stepping at upper storeys where required by local plan or to reduce visual bulk. Balconies set back to create privacy buffers to adjacent properties.\n- Sun/path studies: position living rooms and main glazing to the east/west/south elevations where possible; avoid deep-plan layouts that require artificial lighting during daytime.\n\n4.2 Typical floorplate & circulation\n- Central core(s) containing lift(s) and stair(s). For buildings with up to 12 units per core, one lift + one staircase is typically adequate; larger cores may require an additional escape stair depending on fire strategy.\n- Core sizing: lift cabin minimum 1.1\u20131.4 m x 1.4\u20131.4 m to meet accessibility (platform lift not acceptable for multi-storey residential).\n- Circulation strategy: stacked wet walls and service risers to reduce lateral MEP distribution and heat loss.\n\n4.3 Apartment typologies (example)\n- Type A \u2014 1BR / 1B (approx. 45\u201355 m\u00b2). Suitable for single professionals and couples. Open-plan living/kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, storage/wardrobe.\n- Type B \u2014 2BR / 1\u20132B (approx. 65\u201380 m\u00b2). Target family market and sharers. Separate living/dining, two bedrooms, bathroom + en-suite or second WC where possible.\n- Type C \u2014 3BR / 2B (approx. 85\u2013100 m\u00b2). Family units with clear bedroom separation and better storage.\n- Adaptable / accessible unit variant: provide threshold-free circulation, bathroom layouts allowing future adaptation (reinforced walls for grab rails).\n\nExample unit mix scenarios (for GFA = 2,500 m\u00b2). See Appendix A for a sample area schedule and plan sketches.\n\n4.4 Typical floor efficiency & servicing\n- Net/gross target: 75\u201380% (we assume 78%). This implies circulation, cores and plant represent ~22% of GFA.\n- Typical stacked services: kitchens and wet rooms aligned vertically to limit horizontal MEP runs and reduce penetrations.\n- Mechanical plant: plant located in basement/ground or roof plant room to minimise noise and maintain headroom.\n\n4.5 Balconies, terraces & private outdoor space\n- Balconies: approximate size 4\u20138 m\u00b2 per apartment where possible, positioned to provide afternoon sun and privacy screens to adjacent apartments.\n- Privacy and shading: use perforated screens, planting zones or brise-soleil where necessary.\n\n4.6 Acoustic & daylighting targets\n- Daylight: target average daylight factor (ADF) in living areas to meet recommended values (varies with room geometry). Use larger glazing ratios on primary fa\u00e7ades and careful recess depth for balconies.\n- Acoustic: comply with DIN 4109 for sound insulation; target higher standards (e.g., 5 dB better than statutory) where adjacent to busy roads.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Materials, systems & sustainability\n\n5.1 Structure options and implications\n- Reinforced concrete: conventional for mid-rise urban buildings in Germany. Advantages: predictable cost, fire resistance, sound insulation, thermal mass. Typical superstructure cost share used in budget.\n- Hybrid timber-concrete: cross-laminated timber (CLT) panels with concrete cores/ground floor. Advantages: reduced embodied carbon, faster erection, lighter foundations. Considerations: higher material cost (premium ~5\u201310%), coordination for MEP penetrations, fire detailing and acoustic joints.\n- Structural cost sensitivity: hybrid timber could increase superstructure cost by ~\u20ac50\u2013100/m\u00b2, but may reduce schedule by several weeks and lower embodied carbon.\n\n5.2 Fa\u00e7ade & thermal performance\n- Preferred fa\u00e7ade strategies:\n  - Insulated masonry or blockwork with external render (cost-effective, robust).\n  - Prefabricated ventilated rainscreen with insulation (improved detailing, modularity).\n- Windows: high-performance triple-glazed where required. Target Uw \u2264 1.1 W/m\u00b2K for window assemblies (frames + glazing).\n- Airtightness: target n50 \u2264 1.0\u20131.5 h\u207b\u00b9 at concept; better performance recommended (n50 \u2264 1.0) to reduce heating demand and meet KfW/low-energy targets.\n\n5.3 Building services (HVAC & ventilation)\n- Heating: decentralized heat-pump systems (air-source heat pumps for each dwelling or central heat pump with distribution) depending on building size and space constraints.\n- Domestic hot water: consider centralised domestic hot water with heat-pump preheat and solar thermal or PV-assisted backup for peak demand reduction.\n- Ventilation: mechanical ventilation with heat recovery (MVHR) is recommended where budget allows. For mid-range cost planning MVHR delivers energy savings, good IAQ and supports airtight construction.\n- Cooling: passive measures (shading, thermal mass). Localised cooling or ducted systems only if the client requires.\n\nPerformance targets and indicative values:\n- Heat demand: aim < 40 kWh/m\u00b2a for heating (aspiring to KfW 55 or better).\n- Primary energy demand: target in line with GEG and KfW requirements (values to be set once final building form and systems are defined).\n- Renewable energy provision: photovoltaic (PV) on roof to supply common area loads and charging infrastructure; explore battery storage to smooth demand profiles.\n\n5.4 Water, finishes & internal fit-out\n- Low-flow sanitary fittings to reduce water demand (e.g., 6\u20139 l/min showers, dual-flush toilets).\n- Durable internal finishes: engineered timber flooring in living areas, porcelain tiles in wet rooms, resilient flooring in service areas.\n- Kitchen & bathroom strategy: standard modular kitchen and bathroom options with two or three upgrade choices. Standardization reduces bespoke joinery costs.\n\n5.5 Sustainable materials & embodied carbon\n- Embodied carbon targets: early-stage assessment recommended. Hybrid timber strategies can potentially reduce embodied carbon by 15\u201325% relative to concrete-only superstructures (subject to substructure and cladding choices).\n- Material selection: low-VOC paints, responsibly-sourced timber (FSC), locally-sourced masonry where practical.\n\n5.6 Waste, recycling & circularity\n- Construction waste management plan required during works; target 85\u201390% diversion from landfill.\n- Design for disassembly: where possible use mechanical fixings, modular fa\u00e7ades and standardized components to support future adaptability and maintenance.\n\n5.7 Electrical & EV infrastructure\n- Electrical infrastructure sized for future electrification. Recommend pre-provision for EV charging at each parking bay or centralised tenant charging with spare ducting and distribution capacity.\n- Cost note: EV-ready parking pre-installation (conduits and spare capacity) is modest; full provision of 1:1 chargers adds significant cost per bay (~\u20ac2.5k\u2013\u20ac6k per charger for wiring and installation; if 3-phase and metering required cost higher).\n\n---\n\n## 6. Accessibility, fire & statutory compliance\n\n6.1 Accessibility targets\n- Compliance: design to meet national and local accessibility regulations; consider DIN standards where applicable.\n- Unit adaptations: provide at least 5% adaptable dwellings to MDS/Bauordnungen requirements (step-free access, reinforced WC walls, wheelchair circulation).\n- Thresholds: threshold-free main entrances to building and accessible apartments with minimum door clearances and bathroom turning circles.\n\n6.2 Fire safety overview (concept stage)\n- Escape routes: central stair designed as protected staircase with adequate width and separation depending on occupant load. Travel distances to exits to meet local code.\n- Compartmentation: typical residential compartment size to be determined with fire engineer. Fire-rated walls and floors at core interfaces and between apartments as required.\n- Detection & alarming: provide automatic smoke detection in escape routes and common areas; dwellings to have heat/smoke alarms as per LBO/Feuerwehr requirements.\n- Fire brigade access: ensure adequate external access for fire engines, hydrants and turning where required; location and sizing of external hydrant to be coordinated with local Feuerwehr.\n\n6.3 Statutory considerations\n- Energy compliance: GEG (Geb\u00e4udeenergiegesetz) compliance mandatory. Consider KfW funding levels for low energy buildings.\n- Planning: the local Bebauungsplan (if present) will dictate building envelope, ridge heights, setbacks and permitted uses. Early engagement with planning authority recommended.\n- Noise protection: where adjacent to highways or commercial uses, acoustic facade and glazing specification to address L\u00e4rmpegel per local regulations and DIN standards.\n\n6.4 Accessibility & Safety checklist (concept)\n- Accessible main entrance and lobby with level approach.\n- Lift access to all residential floors and accessible flats on each floor.\n- Adaptable bathrooms/en-suite reinforcement for future grab rail installation.\n- Clear signage and emergency lighting in accordance with DIN/VDE standards.\n- Fire stopping details for service penetrations and compartment interfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 7.

Assumptions, exclusions & risks\n\n11.1 Key assumptions (recap)\n- No abnormal ground conditions.\n- No heritage restrictions or complicated demolition constraints.\n- Typical local authority planning processes and timescales.\n- Standard mid-range finishes and supplier availability.\n\n11.2 Exclusions (not included in estimates)\n- Land acquisition costs.\n- VAT, financing and developer interest costs.\n- Specialist tenant fit-outs beyond standard kitchens and bathrooms.\n- Off-site remediation or unexpected contamination.\n- Local developer contributions or levies (if applicable).\n- Any statutory improvement costs demanded by local authority (e.g., highway works).\n\n11.3 Risk register (concept-level)\n| Risk | Probability (L/M/H) | Impact (L/M/H) | Mitigation | Contingency allowance |\n|---|---:|---:|---|---:|\n| Unexpected ground conditions requiring piling | M | H | Early geotechnical survey; allow piling options in design | 5\u201310% of substructure cost |\n| Planning objections / extended authority review | M | M | Pre-application engagement; community consultation | Programme buffer |\n| Market price inflation during tender | H | M\u2013H | Early appointment of QS; ECI; fixed-price tender windows | 6\u201310% contingency |\n| Scope creep / client changes to finishes | M | M | Clear scope freeze dates and design packages | 5% client change contingency |\n| Specialist supply chain delays (fa\u00e7ade / bespoke elements) | M | M | Early ordering & long-lead procurement | Programme buffer |\n| Need for extensive basement or retaining works | L\u2013M | H | Site topographical survey and geotech; design options | Additional budgeted sums (see Section 9) |\n\n11.4 Contingency strategy\n- Use tiered contingency:\n  - Design contingency (6\u20138%) at concept for unknowns.\n  - Tender contingency (contractor\u2019s contingencies) for pricing errors or omissions.\n  - Client change contingency (5%) to cover scope variations requested after tender.\n\n---\n\n## 12. Procurement & contract strategy\n\n12.1 Recommended procurement route\n- Preferred route: Traditional design-bid-build with early contractor involvement (ECI) at end of Stage 2 (concept) or tendering through two-stage negotiated tender with preferred contractor.\n  - Rationale: ECI allows pricing of alternates, value engineering and programme forecasting while maintaining design control.\n- Alternative: Design & Build (D&B) if client prefers single point responsibility and is prepared to trade some design control for price certainty.\n\n12.2 Tender strategy\n- Issue an initial pre-qualification (PQQ) to shortlist 4\u20136 contractors to ensure market interest and quality.\n- Provide clear tender packages for subcontractor pricing (fa\u00e7ade, MEP, internal finishes).\n- Encourage contractors to submit alternative solutions that meet performance criteria (e.g., hybrid timber vs concrete) with cost & programme impacts.\n\n12.3 Contract forms\n- Recommended contractual form: FIDIC / VOB-B adapted to German practice or bespoke JCT-style form with clear payment milestones and variation control.\n- For negotiated two-stage: Use agreements that allow early works to be priced and included into a firm GMP (guaranteed maximum price) once packages are fixed.\n\n12.4 Procurement milestones & payments (example)\n- RIBA Stage 2 (concept) completion: 10% of design fee milestone.\n- Planning submission: 20% milestone.\n- Tender issue and return: QS interim cost check and sign-off.\n- Contractor appointment: mobilisation deposit (e.g., 5\u201310% of contract sum).\n- Monthly valuations during works with retention (e.g., 5% retention until defects rectified).\n\n---\n\n## 13. Recommendations & next steps\n\nImmediate actions (within 2\u20134 weeks)\n1. Confirm project brief and core assumptions in Section 2:\n   - Confirm GFA, target finishes, desired unit mix and parking strategy.\n2. Commission site surveys:\n   - Topographical survey, Batched utilities survey, Geotechnical investigation (Geotech B\u00fcro Mayer recommended).\n3. Appoint core consultants:\n   - Quantity Surveyor (Baukosten GmbH recommended for initial cost plan), Structural Engineer and MEP Engineer.\n4. Undertake pre-application meeting with the local planning authority \u2014 obtain early advice on permitted massing and constraints.\n5. If budget certainty is a priority, instruct QS to prepare an elemental cost plan and initiate contractor market sounding for two-stage procurement.\n\nMeeting proposal (agenda)\n- Duration: 60 minutes (in person or video).\n- Attendees: Client decision-maker, Oscar (Awesome Inc.), QS representative, Geotech rep (optional), Planning contact (optional).\n- Proposed agenda:\n  1. Confirmation of site information and GFA (5 min).\n  2. Review of proposed unit mix and target market (10 min).\n  3. Parking strategy and local constraints (10 min).\n  4. Sustainability targets and KfW aspirations (10 min).\n  5. Cost envelope and acceptable risk (10 min).\n  6. Next steps, responsibilities and timescale (10 min).\n- Deliverables from meeting: agreed brief and a written meeting note with actions and timescales.\n\nLonger-term recommendations\n- Appoint QS prior to completing technical design to evolve the cost plan to elemental and trade-level pricing.\n- Engage local planning authority early; consider a planning consultant if the site is complex.\n- If exploring KfW grants or DGNB certification, agree targets now; early decisions on building fabric and services will materially affect costs and performance.\n\n---\n\n## 14. Appendices\n\nAppendix A \u2014 Example area schedule (GFA = 2,500 m\u00b2; net/gross efficiency 78%)\n- Gross Floor Area (GFA): 2,500 m\u00b2\n- Net residential area (approx. GFA \u00d7 0.78): 1,950 m\u00b2\n- Common areas, circulation & plant: 550 m\u00b2 (22% of GFA)\n\nSample unit mix option (illustrative)\n| Unit type | Unit size (m\u00b2 net) | Quantity | Total net area (m\u00b2) |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|\n| 1BR (Type A) | 50 | 6 | 300 |\n| 1BR (compact) | 45 | 4 | 180 |\n| 2BR (Type B) | 75 | 8 | 600 |\n| 2BR (larger) | 80 | 4 | 320 |\n| 3BR (Type C) | 95 | 4 | 380 |\n| Total apartments | \u2014 | 26 | 1,780 |\n\nNotes:\n- The above mix yields 26 units and totals 1,780 m\u00b2 net apartments; the remaining net area (170 m\u00b2) could be allocated to storage, staff/common rooms, or slightly increased apartment sizes.\n- If a higher average apartment size is desired, reduce unit count accordingly.\n\nAppendix B \u2014 Typical apartment layouts (schematic descriptions)\n- Type A (1BR, 50 m\u00b2): Open-plan living/kitchen with access to balcony (4\u20136 m\u00b2), bedroom with built-in wardrobe, bathroom with walk-in shower, storage cupboard on corridor.\n- Type B (2BR, 75 m\u00b2): Central hallway with storage, L-shaped living/dining/kitchen opening to balcony, master bedroom with en-suite, second bedroom suitable for child/office, main bathroom, laundry cupboard.\n- Type C (3BR, 95 m\u00b2): Larger living/dining area with generous balcony, kitchen with pantry, two bathrooms (one en-suite), three bedrooms with flexibility for home office, store room.\n\nAppendix C \u2014 Planning submission checklist (example)\n- Site location plan (measure to scale)\n- Existing and proposed site plans\n- Floor plans (all levels)\n- Elevations and sections\n- Design & access statement and material palette\n- Daylight/sunlight and overshadowing analysis (if requested)\n- Tree survey and landscaping proposals\n- Noise impact assessment (if required)\n- Energy concept & GEG compliance note\n- Fire strategy outline\n\nAppendix D \u2014 Contact list & references\n- Architecture lead: Oscar \u2014 Awesome Inc. (email / phone) [provide client-specific contact details]\n- Recommended Quantity Surveyor: Baukosten GmbH \u2014 Contact: Frau M\u00fcller (email / phone)\n- Recommended Geotechnical consultant: Geotech B\u00fcro Mayer \u2014 Contact: Herr Mayer (email / phone)\n- Guidance documents: GEG (Geb\u00e4udeenergiegesetz), DIN 4109 (acoustic), DIN EN standards for glazing & U-values, local Bauordnung and Bebauungsplan documentation.\n\n---\n\nPrepared by:  \nOscar \u2014 Architect, Awesome Inc.\n\nEnd of document.\n\nIf you would like, I can:\n- Convert the area schedule into a downloadable spreadsheet (CSV/XLSX) with unit-by-unit data.\n- Produce two alternative detailed unit-mix options with corresponding updated cost and programme implications.\n- Prepare an annotated pre-application pack for the local planning authority including a short design & access statement and massing images.",
