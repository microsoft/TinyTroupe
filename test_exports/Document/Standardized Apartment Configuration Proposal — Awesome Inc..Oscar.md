# Standardized Apartment Configuration Proposal — Awesome Inc.

## Executive summary
This document proposes a standardized product line of apartment configurations and a complementary catalogue of standard elements for Awesome Inc. The aim is to deliver high-quality, cost-effective, and sustainable mid-rise residential buildings that clients can select from pre-defined configurations. The package includes: a clear design concept, standardized unit types (Studio, 1BR, 2BR), a modular construction strategy (prefab wet cores & kitchen modules), a materials/finish matrix with three selectable quality levels, regulatory and compliance guidance aligned to German standards, a detailed cost estimate for a representative building, sensitivity and lifecycle analyses, and a recommended programme with named owners and acceptance criteria.

Key outcomes:
- Repeatable design solutions reducing time-to-market for new developments.
- Predictable costs and simplified procurement using modular, prefabricated components.
- Improved build quality, lower defect rates and faster on-site programmes via prefabrication.
- A mid-range to premium product offering with lifecycle-focused choices (higher initial cost options that reduce operating costs).

Assumption for baseline building used in cost analysis: 5-storey mid-rise, 20 residential units, average net dwelling area 60 m², gross floor area (GFA) ~1,200 m². Urban site in Germany, typical inner-suburban constraints, no complex geotechnical issues. All figures in EUR, excluding VAT unless stated.

## 1. Project objectives and scope (expanded)
Primary objectives:
- Create a set of repeatable apartment types (Studio, 1BR, 2BR) with dimensioned layouts, furniture plans, and fixed element lists to enable quick client selection and rapid technical development.
- Provide a standard elements catalogue (kitchen modules, bathroom pods, windows, doors, flooring, fixed storage, balcony systems) to avoid bespoke design and minimize procurement complexity.
- Optimize the product line for:
  - Buildability: minimized on-site variability via vertical stacking, repeatable slab penetrations and prefabrication.
  - Regulatory compliance: meet or exceed German building regulations including the Gebäudeenergiegesetz (GEG), DIN standards for accessibility and acoustic performance, and local Feuerpolizei requirements.
  - Long-term value: focus on durable materials, maintainable systems and solutions that reduce total cost of ownership.
  - Market positioning: mid-range to premium — three finish levels to align with different budgets and target markets.

Scope boundaries:
- This proposal covers architectural typologies, standard element technical definitions, modular integration strategy, cost modelling and programme. It excludes specific site acquisition, detailed geotechnical remediation scopes, long-term financing arrangements (beyond contingency and soft cost allowances), and bespoke legal advice.

Assumptions:
- Typical inner-suburban German building lot with standard utilities access.
- No major restrictions for building height beyond local zoning (assumed allowed at 5 storeys).
- Availability of local manufacturers/suppliers for prefabricated bathroom pods and kitchen modules.

Deliverables from concept stage:
- Dimensioned typical plans and elevations for each apartment type.
- Standard elements catalogue (spec sheet and supplier options).
- Preliminary MEP coordination drawings for risers and prefab interfaces.
- Baseline cost model and sensitivity scenarios for early decisions.

## 2. Design principles and performance targets (expanded)
Design principles:
- Simplicity & clarity: aim for simple floor plates, compact circulation (central cores), and mono-directional apartment layouts to maximize daylight and reduce plan complexity.
- Flexibility & modularity: unit modules designed with repeatable structural bays and alignment of plumbing and ventilation risers to permit vertical stacking and module repetition.
- Sustainability & resilience:
  - Target primary energy demand reduction vs. reference building: 20–35% (depending on selected systems and PV).
  - PV-ready roof and structural allowance for future PV installation if not provided immediately.
  - Low-VOC finishes and materials with E1 formaldehyde limit where possible.
- User wellbeing: daylight factors targeted at >2% for living rooms and kitchen-living areas; natural ventilation where possible; acoustic performance targets per DIN 4109 and ISO standards; provision for private outdoor space (balcony or terrace).

Performance targets (typical):
- Thermal Insulation: U-values (indicative)
  - External wall: 0.20–0.18 W/m²K (mid-range to premium)
  - Roof: 0.15–0.12 W/m²K
  - Ground floor slab: 0.20–0.18 W/m²K
  - Windows (triple-glazed): Uw ≤ 0.95 W/m²K
- Airtightness target: n50 ≤ 1.0–1.5 1/h (blower-door), depending on product level.
- Mechanical ventilation: MVHR performance (where used) with SFP ≤ 1.8 kW/(m³/s) and heat recovery efficiency ≥ 70%.
- Acoustic separation: airborne sound insulation R’w ≥ 55 dB for party walls; impact sound ≤ 53 dB L’n,w in floors (upgradeable for premium).

Sustainability targets:
- Climate-related: Option to achieve KfW/Effizienzhaus levels (KfW 55/40 equivalents) where client chooses premium systems and increases envelope performance.
- Materials: preference for locally-sourced materials, recyclable insulation (mineral wool with documented recycled content or natural alternatives), and FSC/PEFC-certified timber for joinery.

## 6. Regulatory & compliance notes (detailed)

Design and documentation will reference applicable German standards and industry best practice. Below is a non-exhaustive checklist and explanation for compliance.

6.1 Energy & thermal (GEG and related)
- Building to be designed with consideration for GEG (Gebäudeenergiegesetz) requirements for primary energy demand and thermal protection:
  - Provide modelling outputs (PHPP or dynamic simulation) at technical design to demonstrate compliance.
  - Where MVHR is considered, ensure free heat recovery rates and SFP are included in model.
- Renewable energy measures:
  - PV roof readiness: structural load allowance for PV (including ballast or mounting).
  - Option to include air/water heat pumps or district heating connection where available.

6.2 Accessibility (DIN 18040 family)
- At least one accessible/entrance-level unit per development as standard; adopt DIN 18040-2 guidance for residential buildings for dimensions, door widths (min 90 cm for accessible doors), bathroom turning circles and thresholds.
- Provide adaptable units (construction allowing easy conversion to full accessibility).

6.3 Fire safety / egress
- Coordinate with local Feuerpolizei and fire brigade early. Items to include:
  - Stair width and number of escape routes per floor occupancy.
  - Smoke control (stair pressurization if required), automatic detection in common areas, apartment smoke alarm recommendations.
  - Compartmentation strategy and fire-resisting elements (floor/ceiling and corridor partitions).
- Fire doors and glazing to be specified to appropriate fire resistance ratings (e.g., EI30/EI60).

6.4 Acoustic performance
- Design to DIN 4109 and DIN EN ISO 12354 methods:
  - Party walls: airborne sound insulation target R’w ≥ 55 dB (upgrade options for premium).
  - Floors: impact sound insulation L’n,w ≤ 53 dB (improved values achievable with floating floors).
  - Noise control strategy for mechanical plant — MEP silencing and ductwork design.

6.5 Structural and geotechnical
- Standard slab and foundation design (strip or pad) to be determined by geotechnical report. Allowances in baseline cost for typical shallow foundations; contingency for piled solutions if required at tender.

6.6 Health & safety
- Temporary site safety plan and method statements for crane-lift of pods, façade panels and heavy deliveries.
- Asbestos and hazardous material checks if existing site building demolished prior (not included in baseline estimate).

6.7 Planning considerations
- Typical planning constraints such as daylight/overshadowing assessments, parking provision (local policy), and urban design requirements will be addressed in technical design.

Regulatory references (indicative):
- Gebäudeenergiegesetz (GEG), 2020 (and subsequent amendments)
- DIN 18040 (barrier-free building)
- DIN 4108 (thermal protection)
- DIN 4109 (noise protection)
- DIN EN ISO 12354 (acoustic performance)
- DIN EN 1634 (fire resistance testing)
- Local building codes and Feuerpolizei requirements (to be confirmed on site)

Compliance checklist (to be completed at technical design stage):

## 7. Cost estimate methodology, assumptions and detailed breakdown

Methodology summary:
- Costs are built up from GFA applied unit rates, adjusted by unit mix and type-specific fit-out allowances.
- Prefab items (bathroom pods, kitchen modules) costed as manufactured product plus installation and interface works.
- Soft costs applied as percentages of construction, with owner-level contingency applied after soft costs.
- All figures are indicative baseline estimates for budgeting. A full QS should be prepared at the end of technical design.

Baseline assumptions:
- Representative building: GFA 1,200 m²
- Construction unit cost: 2,600 EUR/m² GFA (mid-range sustainable specification; includes prefab pods and performance envelope)
- Construction cost total: 1,200 m² * 2,600 EUR/m² = 3,120,000 EUR

7.1 Construction cost breakdown (detailed)

| Cost category | % of construction | Amount (EUR) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Substructure & shell (foundations, structure, envelope) | 45% | 1,404,000 | Includes external walls, windows, roof, structural frame |
| Interiors & finishes (kitchens, bathrooms, flooring, doors) | 20% | 624,000 | Prefab pods and kitchen modules included here |
| MEP (heating, ventilation, plumbing, electrics) | 20% | 624,000 | Includes plant, distribution and final fixings |
| External works & landscaping | 5% | 156,000 | Access, paving, planting, cycle stores |
| Site preliminaries & hoarding | 2% | 62,400 | Temporary works and onsite facilities |
| Contractor contingency (on construction works) | 5% | 156,000 | Client to accept or adjust based on procurement |

Construction subtotal: 3,120,000 EUR

Soft costs and owner-level items:

| Soft cost item | % (or value) | Amount (EUR) | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Architecture & engineering fees (design + technical) | ~8% | 249,600 | Includes structural, MEP, coordination (owner: Oscar/design team) |
| Permit fees, surveys, special consultants | ~3% | 93,600 | Geotech, fire, acoustic consultants |
| Owner-level project contingency | 5% of total project | ~180,000 | Recommended for budget risk |
| Client allowances & pre-sales marketing | allowance | 30,000 | Selection booklet, showflat fittings (estimate) |

Estimated total project cost (construction + soft costs + contingencies):  
3,120,000 + 249,600 + 93,600 + 180,000 + 30,000 = 3,673,200 EUR (rounded)

Baseline per-unit average (20 units): ~183,660 EUR per unit (baseline)

7.2 Unit-level cost allocation (sample)
This table shows a notional allocation of costs to unit types using area share and premium fit-out allowances.

| Unit type | Qty | Net area (m²) | GFA (m²) | Share of GFA | Allocated cost (construction) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Studio (35) | 4 | 35 | 161.0 | 13.42% | 3,120,000 * 0.1342 = 418,700 |
| 1-BR (55) | 10 | 55 | 632.5 | 52.71% | 1,643,000 |
| 2-BR (75) | 6 | 75 | 517.5 | 43.08% | 1,343,000 |
Total GFA allocated: 1,311 m² (note: minor rounding due to conversion factors; allocation adjusted to total construction sum)

Average per unit (including soft costs pro rata):
- Studios: approx. 418,700 / 4 = 104,675 EUR (construction share) + soft costs = ~135–150k per studio depending on allocation.
- 1-BR: 1,643,000 / 10 = 164,300 EUR (construction) + soft costs = ~200–215k.
- 2-BR: 1,343,000 / 6 = 223,833 EUR (construction) + soft costs = ~270–290k.

Note: These per-unit figures are indicative and will be refined with a full QS.

7.3 Itemised allowances (examples)
- Prefab bathroom pod (mid-range): 7–10 kEUR per pod (including fit and interface).
- Kitchen module:
  - Economy: 2.5–4 kEUR
  - Standard: 4.5–7 kEUR
  - Premium: 8–12 kEUR
- Windows: 300–450 EUR/m² window area (triple-glazed mid-range)
- MVHR unit: 1.5–3.0 kEUR per dwelling for compact units (plus ductwork and commissioning)
- Heat pump (air-to-water) system allocation per building: 35–60 kEUR (plant and primary distribution).
- PV system (rooftop, installed): 1,000–1,400 EUR/kWp depending on scale — a 10 kWp system ~10–14 kEUR.

7.4 Contingency rationale
- Contractor contingency (5%): covers unforeseen construction-level items.
- Owner-level contingency (5% after soft costs): covers scope changes, escalation risk, finance or market-driven cost increases.

## 8. Sensitivity analysis and scenarios

This section quantifies impacts of key variations on baseline totals.

8.1 Material/labour escalation
- +/-10% on construction costs:
  - +10%: construction becomes 3,432,000 EUR (+312,000)
  - -10%: construction becomes 2,808,000 EUR (-312,000)

8.2 Finish level variation (Economy → Premium)
- Interiors & finishes line = 624,000 EUR baseline
  - Economy package (reduce by 20%): -124,800 EUR
  - Premium package (increase by 25–40%): +156,000–249,600 EUR

8.3 PV and Heat Pump adoption
- Option A: PV-only modest (5–10 kWp): +5–14 kEUR upfront; payback depending on export/feed-in tariffs and self-consumption.
- Option B: Full decarbonisation package (heat pump + MVHR + PV): +60–120 kEUR upfront (as noted), with operating cost reduction estimates of 30–60% vs baseline gas-based approach — payback period typically 6–12 years depending on energy price trajectory and subsidies (e.g., KfW grants or BAFA incentives).

8.4 Prefab pod premium vs conventional wet trades
- Prefab premium (manufacture + transport + craning): 2–4 kEUR per pod premium vs site-built alternative, but saved on-site wet trade and reduced programme. Net benefit often appears when factoring reduced site time (labour savings) and lower snagging — estimated programme saving 6–10 weeks which reduces prelim costs and allows earlier rental income.

8.5 Scenario matrix (summary)

| Scenario | Construction cost change | Net effect on total project cost | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Base | 2,600 €/m² | ~3.67M total | Baseline sustainable mid-range |
| +10% materials/labour | +312k | ~3.99M | Escalation risk |
| Premium finishes | +156–250k | ~3.83–3.92M | Market upgrade |
| Add full decarb package | +60–120k | ~3.73–3.79M | Lifecycle benefits |
| Economy finishes & partial PV | -125k + 10k | ~3.56M | Lower capex, higher Opex |

## 9. Lifecycle & operating considerations (LCCA) — extended

9.1 Rationale
Investment in higher-performance building elements (windows, insulation, heat pump systems, PV) increases initial capex but reduces energy operating costs and potentially increases rental value and time-on-market. Lifecycle cost analysis (LCCA) considers capital, energy, maintenance, and replacement over a defined period (e.g., 30 years).

9.2 Simple LCCA example (illustrative)
Assumptions:
- Baseline heating system: gas boiler, annual energy cost per unit (for heating + hot water) = 1,200 EUR
- Upgrade: heat pump + MVHR + PV reduces annual energy cost to 450 EUR (savings = 750 EUR per unit/year)
- Additional capital cost per unit for upgrade: 3,000 EUR (share of building system)
- Discount rate: 3%
- Analysis period: 20 years

Net present value (NPV) of energy savings per unit:
- Annual savings 750 EUR, discounted at 3% over 20 years ⇒ NPV ≈ 11,300 EUR
- Payback: 3,000 / 750 ≈ 4 years simple payback

Conclusion (illustrative): For most mid-rise residential, investing in efficient systems has favourable payback when energy prices are moderate-high and subsidies apply.

9.3 Maintenance & replacement allowances (recommended annual allowances)
- Plant & equipment (heat pumps, MVHR): set aside 1.0–1.5% of initial plant capex annually for replacement/maintenance.
- Exterior envelope: medium term maintenance (repointing, façade cleaning) allowance every 25–30 years.
- Finishes (flooring, kitchens): kitchens expected life 15–20 years; allowances for upgrades/replacements recommended.

9.4 Warranty & aftercare
- Typical contractor defects period: 12 months plus longer structural or waterproofing guarantees as negotiated (e.g., 5–10 years for certain items).
- Prefab modules: supplier warranties often 2–5 years for specific elements; ensure handover packs and assignment of warranties in contract.

## 10. Programme & milestones (detailed)

High-level timeline for repeatable product rollout and a representative project (weeks and months provided as typical ranges).

10.1 Product rollout (repeatable product catalogue)
- Concept finalisation & product catalogue: 2–4 weeks — Owner: Oscar (design lead) with Anna for finishes.
- Prototyping & mock-up (prefab pod and façade detail): 4–6 weeks — Owner: Richard & manufacturer lead.
- Finalise standard element specs and procurement template: 2 weeks — Procurement & John.
- Marketing & pre-sales package production: 3 weeks — Anna & marketing team.
- Pilot build or demonstration unit (optional): 12–16 weeks.

10.2 Representative project schedule (from concept to handover)
- Phase 0: Project mobilisation & site due diligence (4 weeks)
- Phase 1: Concept design & product selection (2–4 weeks) — deliverable: finalized unit plans and finish selection booklet.
- Phase 2: Technical design & coordination (6–8 weeks) — structural, MEP and prefab coordination BIM models.
- Phase 3: Permit submission & approvals (8–12 weeks) — may run in parallel with late technical design.
- Phase 4: Tender & contractor selection (4–6 weeks)
- Phase 5: Site mobilisation & foundation works (8–10 weeks) — depends on groundworks complexity.
- Phase 6: Superstructure, enclosure & prefabrication installation (20–30 weeks) — includes craning of pods and façade panels.
- Phase 7: Internal finishes, commissioning & snagging (8–12 weeks)
- Phase 8: Handover & defects liability start (4 weeks)

Construction typical duration: 12 months from mobilisation to practical completion for this building footprint with prefabrication.

10.3 Critical path (summary)
- Long lead items: prefabricated pods and façade components — early procurement and design freeze required.
- Permit approvals: early engagement with authorities strongly recommended to avoid delays.
- Structural and MEP coordination: clash detection and interface resolution via BIM essential.

## 12. Procurement and contract strategy

Recommended procurement routes:
- Two-stage design & build with early contractor involvement (ECI):
  - Benefits: contractor engaged early, input on buildability and prefab installation, potential cost certainty on stage two.
- Alternatively, design-bid-build with prefabrication packages tendered to specialist suppliers:
  - For high competition on modules and clear technical specs.
- Contract forms: FIDIC short form or standard German VOB/B contracts as appropriate — legal counsel to advise.

Procurement recommendations:
- Pre-qualify manufacturers for bathroom pods and kitchen modules (evaluate references, factory capacity, QA systems, warranty terms).
- Tender in packages: main contractor, prefab pod supplier, façade supplier, windows, MEP subcontractors — coordinate interfaces in tender documents.
- Include performance-based specifications where possible (e.g., acoustic outcomes and energy performance targets) rather than overly prescriptive material lists.

Payment & risk allocation:
- Split payments for prefabricated modules between factory stage acceptance, delivery to site, and final installation sign-off.
- Liability and warranty periods clearly defined, with retention to ensure defect correction.

Tender package contents (summary — full list in Appendix):
- Drawings: dimensioned plans, elevations, sections, typical details
- Specification: performance-based and prescriptive items
- BIM models and interface schedules
- Bill of Quantities (BoQ) / activity schedule
- Site constraints and logistics requirements
- Programme and payment schedule

## 14. Recommendations (prioritised — expanded)
1. Adopt prefab bathroom pods and kitchen modules to speed construction, improve quality control, and reduce on-site wet trades. Prioritise early supplier engagement and a full mock-up.
2. Standardize three finish packages (Economy / Standard / Premium) with clear price deltas and visual sample boards. Anna to develop finish boards, sample boxes and client selection booklet for decision-making sessions.
3. Invest in a high-performance window specification and compact MVHR system where possible — these yield the best value in reducing energy demand and improving acoustics.
4. Use the baseline cost model for early budgeting but require a detailed quantity survey (QS) at the end of technical design; John should sign off on contingency levels before tender.
5. Provide at least one accessible or wheelchair-adaptable unit on the entrance level as standard to meet DIN 18040 expectations and broaden marketability.
6. Conduct early meetings with local Feuerpolizei to align fire strategy and avoid costly reworks at permit stage.
7. Undertake a mock-up of a bathroom pod and one typical apartment to test interfaces, finishes and client selections — set aside a prototype budget.

## Closing notes
This expanded proposal balances quality, buildability, cost-control and lifecycle value. By standardizing unit types, adopting prefabrication where it provides clear benefit and defining a tight yet flexible procurement strategy, Awesome Inc. can deliver attractive turn-key apartment options efficiently and predictably.

Recommended immediate actions:
1. Approve the concept and confirm the baseline budget envelope so technical design can proceed.
2. Commence early supplier engagement for bathroom pods and kitchen modules (to confirm lead times and refine costs).
3. Schedule pre-application meetings with planning and fire authorities to expedite permit approvals.

If you would like, I can:
- Prepare a unit-by-unit QS spreadsheet with detailed line items (requires site-specific inputs such as local labour rates, soil report and exact finish choices).
- Produce dimensioned CAD drawings for each unit type and an IFC extract for supplier coordination.
- Draft the tender documents (BoQ and specification) ready for issue to pre-qualified contractors.

Owners and contacts:
- Oscar (Design lead / client contact)
- Anna (Finishes & client selection)
- Richard (Structural consultant)
- John (Project manager / budgeting)
- Procurement / Contracts team (to be assigned)
