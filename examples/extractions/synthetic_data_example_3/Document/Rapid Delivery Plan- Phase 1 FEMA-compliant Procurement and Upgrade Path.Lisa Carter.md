# Executive summary

Wild Advice Partners recommends a phased, procurement-friendly approach to deliver FEMA-eligible Phase 1 emergency kits quickly, while preserving a funded upgrade path for Phase 2. The objective is to balance speed (to meet urgent operational timelines and NGO bridge-funding windows) with strict compliance to FEMA eligibility rules, auditable QA evidence, and a clear contractual path for subsequent upgrades.

Key recommendations
- Use a single RFQ/SOW that requires vendor submission of two-option bids: (A) Emergency Minimal / FEMA-critical Phase 1 and (B) Standard / full-spec Phase 2. Bidders must supply fixed upgrade pricing and committed timelines for Phase 2.
- Enforce FEMA eligibility by mandating the one-page FEMA_nonnegotiables_Lisa.pdf as the compliance baseline, and require acceptance evidence (photos, invoices, test results) at delivery for FEMA reimbursement.
- Run parallel tracks: a rapid analytics/compliance review (Lisa Carter) and an RFQ/contracting track (Oscar & Procurement). Secure NGO conditional MOU for bridge funding in parallel to reduce funding risk.
- Use holdback/performance-bond mechanics (contract language provided below) to preserve incentive and cashflow for Phase 2 upgrades.

This report provides: a detailed implementation timeline, owners, step-by-step immediate actions for the next 0–48 hours, expanded procurement and RFQ/SOW language, evaluation criteria and matrix examples, QA and FEMA documentation requirements, a risk register with mitigation measures, deliverables table, a communication plan, and recommended next steps to move to award.

## Background (expanded)

Situation summary
- There is an urgent operational need to procure emergency kits that must be FEMA-eligible for reimbursement. The program has two logical stages:
  - Phase 1: Emergency Minimal — the minimum set of items and specifications required for FEMA eligibility and immediate deployment.
  - Phase 2: Standard / Full-spec — optional upgrades or additions that improve durability, user experience, or lifecycle, but which are not strictly required for FEMA reimbursement.
- Time is critical. Procurement delays risk:
  - Missing response windows for field operations.
  - Losing access to NGO bridge funding earmarked to cover Phase 2 upgrades.
  - Reduced vendor capacity or price increases if award is delayed.

Constraints and assumptions
- Vendors can prepare two-option proposals within 24–36 hours of a clarified RFQ.
- NGO partners can deliver a conditional MOU (to support Phase 2 funding) on a short timeline.
- Procurement/legal will accept a phased-award approach or explicit contract holdback that preserves upgrade mechanics.
- FEMA_nonnegotiables_Lisa.pdf is treated as mandatory baseline for Phase 1 compliance. Vendors must explicitly map line-items to that checklist.

Operational goal
- Award and deliver Phase 1 kits within the operational window (target: shipment initiation within 2 weeks of award), with documented acceptance evidence to support FEMA reimbursement claims.
- Secure contract terms and funding path for Phase 2 so upgrades can be ordered and delivered on a known schedule with fixed costs.

## Recommended approach (expanded and detailed)

Overview
1. Phased competitive award
   - Require two-option bids: Emergency Minimal (Phase 1) and Standard (Phase 2). Bidders must include:
     - Bill of Materials (BOM) with line-item-level mapping to FEMA line-items.
     - Fixed upgrade pricing for converting Phase 1 to Phase 2 per kit or per unit batch.
     - Firm timelines for Phase 1 delivery and Phase 2 upgrade completion (where upgrade may be shipped separately or built-in to initial order).
   - Rationale: This keeps the procurement competitive, shortens time-to-delivery for FEMA-eligible content, and provides financial clarity for funding the upgrades.

2. Protect FEMA eligibility
   - Make FEMA_nonnegotiables_Lisa.pdf an attachment to the RFQ and a mandatory compliance checklist.
   - Require vendors to provide physical evidence (photos, certificates, test reports) tied to line-items at acceptance to ensure allowable FEMA reimbursement.
   - Prioritize anchoring/structural supports, specified materials/tests, and documented acceptance evidence in both evaluation and contractual terms.

3. Parallel tracks
   - Rapid analytics/compliance track (owner: Lisa Carter) to review rebids quickly and flag non-compliance within ~4 hours during working hours; deeper 24-hour pass if required.
   - RFQ/contracting track (owner: Oscar + Procurement) to issue RFQ amendments, manage clarifications, and finalize contract language including holdback/performance bond.
   - Funding track: NGO to post a conditional MOU that defines amount, triggers, permitted uses (limited to Phase 2 upgrades), timing, and basic legal guardrails.

Detailed procurement structure
- Evaluation should use a two-stage scoring matrix:
  1. Mandatory pass/fail compliance to FEMA_nonnegotiables (any failure = disqualification for Phase 1 award).
  2. Weighted scoring for price, lead time, upgrade price fixedness, vendor capacity, QA plan, and warranty terms.
- Award Phase 1 to the most compliant and responsive vendor that meets FEMA non-negotiables and offers acceptable upgrade pricing & timelines.
- Retain an explicit contractual holdback (recommended 15–30% of Phase 1 value) pending completion of Phase 2 upgrades or submission of upgrade-related deliverables per contract. Alternatively, use an approved performance bond.

Contract mechanics for upgrades
- Include an upgrade option clause with:
  - Fixed unit upgrade price or formula.
  - Guaranteed timeline for upgrade conversion or separate Phase 2 shipments.
  - Remedy clause if vendor fails to perform (e.g., liquidated damages, replacement, or retention of funds for third-party completion).
- Keep Phase 1 acceptance independent of Phase 2 upgrade approval for speed, but condition release of holdback/final payment on successful proof-of-upgrade (if NGO funds will be used to support that release).

## QA, acceptance criteria, and FEMA evidence requirements

Primary acceptance principles
- For FEMA reimbursement, documentation is as important as the physical product. Acceptance must produce a clear, auditable trail linking ordered items to delivered items and payments.

Required artifacts (minimum)
- Signed delivery acceptance certificate per PO line-item.
- High-resolution photos of kits (front/inside/closeups of FEMA-critical items), dated and geo-tagged where possible.
- Manufacturer certificates of conformity or test results for specified materials (e.g., tensile strength, flame resistance).
- Packing list and commercial invoice matching PO line-items and unit counts.
- Bill of materials (BOM) with serial numbers or batch numbers for traceable items.
- QA test reports for structural items (e.g., anchoring/stowage tests) where required by FEMA_nonnegotiables.
- Chain-of-custody documentation if kits are assembled in multiple locations.

Sample acceptance checklist (per delivery batch)
- Delivery documentation:
  - [ ] Bill of lading received
  - [ ] Commercial invoice matches PO
  - [ ] Packing list counts verified
- Physical verification:
  - [ ] Number of kits matches shipment
  - [ ] FEMA-critical items present and match spec
  - [ ] Anchoring/structural supports included and documented
- Evidence captured:
  - [ ] Photos of each kit interior/exterior (3 angles)
  - [ ] Photos of any critical test or installation
  - [ ] Certificates attached for specified materials
- QA signoff:
  - [ ] Vendor internal QA release form
  - [ ] Field QA acceptance with signature and timestamp
  - [ ] Upload of all evidence to shared folder with naming conventions

Evidence naming convention (example)
- {VendorShort}_{PO#}_{Batch#}_{Date YYYYMMDD}_{KitSeq#}_{DocType}.{ext}
  - Example: ACME_PO1234_B01_20260201_KIT001_PHOTO1.jpg

Retention and audit
- All acceptance evidence must be stored in the shared folder and indexed in the compliance mapping spreadsheet. Maintain for at least the FEMA-required period (confirm with agency; typically multi-year). Provide a single packaged audit file per batch for reimbursement submissions.

## Detailed RFQ/SOW amendment guidance (templates and mandatory language)

Key RFQ amendment sections (to include)
1. Introduction & Purpose
2. Submission requirements
3. Two-option bid structure and mandatory content
4. FEMA_nonnegotiables attachment (mandatory compliance baseline)
5. Evaluation criteria and scoring
6. Contractual terms: holdback, upgrade option, warranties, remedies
7. Acceptance & QA evidence required
8. Timeline and delivery milestones
9. Questions & clarifications process
10. Attachments: FEMA_nonnegotiables_Lisa.pdf, sample acceptance certificate, evidence naming convention

Sample RFQ language snippets (editable)
- Two-option bid requirement:
  - “Bidders shall submit two separate and clearly labeled offers:
     - Offer A: Emergency Minimal / Phase 1 (Mandatory FEMA compliance). Must include BOM mapped to FEMA_nonnegotiables.
     - Offer B: Standard / Phase 2 (Optional upgrades). Must include fixed upgrade unit pricing and earliest feasible completion date.
     - Bidders must include a combined summary table showing delta costs and delta lead-times between Offer A and Offer B.”
- Mandatory compliance:
  - “Offer A must fully comply with the FEMA_nonnegotiables checklist. Any omission in Offer A of a FEMA non-negotiable item will lead to disqualification for Phase 1 award.”
- Upgrade option clause (contract preview):
  - “The Purchase Order shall include an Upgrade Option allowing the Buyer to order additional components or upgrades in accordance with Offer B at the fixed prices specified. The Seller guarantees availability of upgrades at the prices and lead-times stated in the bid for a minimum of 120 days from the date of offer submission.”

Suggested holdback clause (procurement-ready language)
- “The Buyer shall withhold [15–30]% of the Phase 1 contract value until final acceptance of Phase 1 deliverables and, where applicable, either: (a) completion and acceptance of Phase 2 upgrades; or (b) submission of NGO funding confirmation for Phase 2 or approved alternate remedy. Liquidated damages for failure to complete upgrades shall be limited to the withheld portion or a pre-agreed amount.”

Suggested performance bond clause
- “The Seller shall provide a performance bond equal to [10–20]% of Phase 1 PO value, or a bank guarantee acceptable to the Buyer, to secure fulfillment of contract obligations including upgrade options. The bond may be drawn upon if the Seller fails to deliver conforming upgrades per contract terms.”

## Evaluation matrix and scorecard (sample)

Use as both procurement evaluation tool and decision aid.

Sample evaluation matrix (weights are illustrative — adjust per procurement policy)

| Criterion | Weight (%) | Minimum pass? | Scoring notes |
|---|---:|:---:|---|
| FEMA Non-negotiables compliance (Offer A) | 30 | Yes (must pass) | Binary: Pass/Fail. Fail = disqualified for Phase 1. |
| Price (Phase 1) | 20 | No | Score inverse to price; lowest gets full points. |
| Upgrade fixed pricing & timeline (Offer B) | 15 | No | Score based on competitiveness and clarity of upgrade path. |
| Lead time (Phase 1 delivery) | 10 | No | Faster lead times score higher. |
| QA plan and evidence readiness | 10 | No | Presence of acceptance tests, evidence plan, certificates. |
| Vendor capacity & past performance | 10 | No | References, production capacity, contingency plans. |
| Warranty & remedies | 5 | No | Warranty period, replacement terms, responsiveness. |
| TOTAL | 100 | — | — |

Example scoring methodology
- For price: Score = (Lowest Price / Vendor Price) * Weight
- For lead time: Score scaled similarly to a minimum acceptable threshold.
- For upgrade pricing: award full points only if fixed in bid and tied to a firm timeline.

Award recommendation decision rule
- All bidders must pass the FEMA non-negotiables check for Offer A to be considered for Phase 1.
- Select the bidder with the highest total weighted score among passing bidders.
- If no bidder passes FEMA non-negotiables, consider emergency procurement exemptions or extend RFQ timeline to allow remedy.

## Risk register (detailed)

Comprehensive risk table with likelihood, impact, and mitigations.

| Risk | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Impact (H/M/L) | Primary owner | Mitigations |
|---|---:|---:|---|---|
| NGO bridge funding delayed or restrictive | M | H | NGO contact / Project lead | Proceed with Phase 1 award using contingency finance; include contractual holdback for Phase 2; seek short-term financing or staged payments; escalate to governance. |
| Vendors omit FEMA-critical items to reduce price | M | H | Procurement / Oscar | Require FEMA_nonnegotiables as mandatory; disqualify non-compliant bids; run rapid compliance checks; include pre-award verification. |
| Procurement legal constraints on phased-award mechanics | M | M | Procurement | Pre-clear contract language; propose use of holdback/performance-bond; prepare waiver paths and escalation to legal counsel. |
| Vendor inability to meet upgrade timelines | M | M | Procurement / Vendor | Require fixed upgrade pricing and committed timeline in bid; include remedies and penalties; have alternate vendors pre-qualified. |
| QA evidence incomplete or insufficient for FEMA | L/M | H | Field QA / Lisa | Provide explicit evidence templates in RFQ; require evidence for acceptance; assign field QA to verify upon delivery; maintain audit package. |
| Supply chain delays for critical components | M | M | Vendor / Procurement | Request vendor capacity statements; require alternate sources; include schedule buffers; consider partial shipments. |
| Price increases post-award due to currency or material costs | M | M | Procurement | Fix prices for Phase 1 in contract; for upgrades, require fixed pricing for a minimum period; include supplier price escalation clauses only with strict caps. |
| Multiple vendors failing compliance, need to re-open competition | L/M | H | Wild Advice Partners / Procurement | Prepare contingency procurement path; allow emergency procurement; increase vendor outreach. |

For each risk, define triggers for escalation (e.g., vendor missing 48-hour milestone, NGO failing to post MOU within 72 hours) and a person responsible for triggering mitigations.

## Budget & funding considerations

High-level financial mechanics
- Phase 1 cost should be evaluated both as standalone and as a component of a combined Phase 1+2 program cost.
- NGO conditional MOU should specify whether funds are contingent on:
  - Proof of Phase 1 delivery and acceptance.
  - Vendor-provided upgrade pricing being fixed and acceptable.
  - A specific timeline for disbursement to enable upgrade completion.

Suggested financial guardrails
- Holdback percentage: 15%–30% of Phase 1 payment retained pending either upgrade completion or NGO confirmation of funding.
- If NGO provides bridge funding, require that funds be held in escrow or released on completion milestones to reduce counterparty risk.
- Consider short-term financing or invoice factoring for vendor cashflow to accelerate delivery if vendor requires up-front capital — only where program risk is acceptably low and contractually secured.

Cost sensitivity example (illustrative)
- Phase 1 unit cost (Offer A): $100 per kit
- Phase 2 upgrade cost (delta): $25 per kit
- Holdback @ 20% per kit: $20 per kit withheld until Phase 2 acceptance or funding confirmation.
- If NGO bridge funding delayed 30 days, vendor may require faster payment terms — consider using a 30% performance bond instead of cash holdback if vendor cashflow is a concern.

---

## Communication plan

Stakeholders and communication responsibilities
- Internal project updates (daily during immediate period): Oscar to email progress updates to distribution list; include stand-up notes, action items, and link to shared folder.
- Vendor communications: Marcos to manage bidder Q&A and issue clarifications publicly to maintain fairness.
- Funding communications: NGO contact to post MOU draft and communicate funding triggers and timelines directly to Procurement and Wild Advice Partners.
- Compliance communications: Lisa to notify Procurement of any immediate compliance red flags and produce memos attached to bid packages.
- Executive escalation: Wild Advice Partners to escalate to executive sponsors if funding or procurement constraints jeopardize timely award.

Suggested cadence
- T+24h: Joint sync call (10:30 local) — review inputs, outstanding clarifications, compliance findings, and obtain consensus for recommendation.
- Daily stand-up (short, 15–20 minutes) during the 0–72 hour window: Oscar (RFQ), Marcos (clarifications), Lisa (compliance), Procurement, NGO rep.
- Weekly steering update for sponsors until Phase 2 funding fully secured.

Email template for urgent RFQ update (example)
- Subject: Urgent: RFQ Amendment Published – Action Required (Phase 1 FEMA Mapping)
- Body: Brief summary, required action, deadlines, link to folder, contact for questions.

## Contract templates and sample clauses (detailed examples)

1. FEMA compliance representation and warranty
- “Seller represents and warrants that Offer A (Emergency Minimal) fully complies with the FEMA_nonnegotiables checklist attached as Appendix A to this Purchase Order. Seller must provide, at delivery, all documentation and evidence described in Section X of this SOW sufficient for Buyer to pursue FEMA reimbursement. Any failure to deliver compliant goods entitles Buyer to remedies including withholding payment, return at Seller expense, or contract termination.”

2. Upgrade option and pricing guarantee
- “Seller guarantees that Upgrade Option pricing (Offer B) shall remain fixed and available for ordering by Buyer for a period of 120 days from bid submission. Should Buyer exercise the Upgrade Option, Seller shall deliver upgraded kits within the timeline specified in Offer B. Failure to meet upgrade timelines shall invoke contract remedies as described in Section Y.”

3. Holdback and performance bond
- Holdback clause (see RFQ section).
- Sample performance bond language provided earlier; procurement to select preferred instrument (bond vs. escrow vs. letter of credit).

4. Acceptance and evidence clause
- “Acceptance of Phase 1 shipments requires: (a) inspection; (b) receipt of evidence files (photos, certificates, invoices) uploaded to Buyer’s shared folder; (c) execution of acceptance certificate. Buyer will release invoice payment per milestones, with the final holdback released upon satisfaction of acceptance evidence and, if applicable, completion of upgrade milestones.”

5. Remedies
- “If Seller fails to deliver compliant Phase 1 or to perform upgrade options per contract, Buyer may pursue remedy including: withholding of holdback; engaging alternate supplier at Seller expense, up to withheld amount; claim against performance bond.”

Legal note: Procurement/legal should adapt clauses to organizational procurement rules and local law. Above is sample language for quick use in drafting.
