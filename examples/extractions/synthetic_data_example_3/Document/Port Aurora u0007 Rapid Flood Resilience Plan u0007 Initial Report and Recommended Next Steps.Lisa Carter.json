Executive summary\n\nPort Aurora faces recurring and increasing flood events that regularly strain available shelter capacity. Municipal budgets are constrained and usual procurement timelines are long. To achieve rapid, equitable improvements to shelter capacity and FEMA-eligibility for funding, we propose a two-track approach:\n\n- Track A \u2014 Rapid analytics-driven diagnostic (0\u20132 weeks): gather the minimum viable data set, run descriptive and prioritized site-selection analytics, and output a 1-page dashboard (hotspots) plus ranked candidate sites for surge capacity interventions. This diagnostic is designed to produce evidence that directly supports FEMA scoring criteria (equity, risk reduction, short-term deployability).\n- Track B \u2014 Near-term operational and shelter interventions (0\u20136 weeks): deploy short-lead-time operational measures (retrofit of existing public buildings, pre-staging supplies), deliver three modular shelter typologies and two retrofit kits with BOMs and cost/lead-time flags, and prepare a FEMA grant package within a 6-week window.\n\nThis report provides immediate recommendations, a detailed owner-assigned timeline for deliverables, technical annexes (typologies, BOMs, finance inputs), a full risk register, templates to accelerate City engagement, and a plan for FEMA submission aligned to anticipated scoring criteria.\n\nKey near-term objective: Submit a FEMA grant application within ~6 weeks that documents prioritized interventions, cost estimates, site maps (using fallback coordinates if shapefiles are delayed), and municipal commitments.\n\n---\n\n2. Situation and scope\n\nProblem statement (expanded)\n- Port Aurora experiences repeated flooding across coastal and low-lying inland neighborhoods. Events generate localized inundation and major events that require temporary sheltering.\n- Current shelter capacity (official and ad-hoc) is likely insufficient to meet simultaneous displacement needs during major flood events.\n- Drainage infrastructure is aging; stormwater conveyance capacity and maintenance records are incomplete.\n- There is a need to balance fast deployment with equity: ensure shelters are sited where vulnerable populations (seniors, mobility-limited, low-income households) can access them.\n\nGoal\n- Produce an evidence-backed, FEMA-aligned plan to increase near-term surge shelter capacity (0\u20136 weeks), prioritize equitable siting decisions, and submit a FEMA-eligible grant package.\n\nScope (what this report covers)\n- Rapid diagnostic methods, prioritized site-selection criteria and immediate candidate list.\n- Operational measures for rapid capacity increases (retrofits, pre-staging supplies).\n- Design and costing for modular shelter typologies and retrofit kits suitable for rapid procurement and local manufacture.\n- Municipal finance modelling for capital and operating costs and FEMA-eligibility mapping.\n- A six-week project plan to produce a complete FEMA submission package.\n\nConstraints and assumptions\n- Data availability is variable; shapefiles/LiDAR may be delayed. Fallback formats must be used.\n- Procurement timelines may preclude full modular deployments within 2 weeks; retrofits of existing buildings are fastest.\n- Budget constraints: we will present low, mid, and high capital cost scenarios.\n- FEMA rules may require municipal match or particular procurement/contracting language \u2014 we will coordinate with City Grants Officer.\n\n---\n\n3. Key findings (based on brief & constraints)\n\nDemand pressure and equity\n- Preliminary municipal inventory (summary inputs) indicates shelter capacity concentrated in central/municipal zones; peripheral high-exposure neighborhoods show high counts of at-risk populations (seniors, limited mobility).\n- Likely gap: surge capacity shortfall of approximately 25\u201340% (estimate range to be refined with data) for a moderate flood event.\n\nData risk and fallback pathways\n- Primary data risk: GIS exports (shapefiles, LiDAR) may be delayed beyond our 72-hour target.\n- Fallback plan: immediately request shelter coordinate CSV, building addresses and capacity tables, scanned emergency plans (PDFs), and historical incident logs.\n\nRapid-intervention opportunities\n- Low-cost modular shelters and rapid retrofit kits exist and can add capacity quickly when combined with retrofits of schools/gyms.\n- Short-lead items: inflatable partitions, privacy screens, portable toilets, ADA ramps, floor coverings \u2014 many available within 0\u20136 weeks via national distributors or local manufacturers.\n\nFEMA-eligibility window\n- FEMA tends to favor projects demonstrating immediate risk reduction, equity-focused site selection, and cost-effectiveness. Short lead-time, municipal-implemented projects with clear deliverables are competitive \u2014 our approach emphasizes these.\n\n---\n\n4. Immediate (0\u20136 week) recommendations (expanded)\n\nA. Rapid diagnostic (owner: Lisa; support: Alex)\n\nObjective: Within 10 business days deliver a one-page dashboard + hotspot list and prioritized candidate sites for surge capacity intervention with supporting datasets and assumptions documented.\n\nActions and method\n1. Data request (send within 24\u201372 hours). Prioritize fallback CSVs/PDFs (see Appendix A).\n2. Ingest available data into an established analytic pipeline (Python/R scripts + QGIS if shapefiles available). Use fallback coordinate CSV to create quick GeoCSV.\n3. Produce the following analytics deliverables:\n   - Descriptive summary table: shelter count, capacity, utilization (% typical), distance to high-exposure areas.\n   - Heat map of flood exposure (historic incidents) overlaid with vulnerable-population density (seniors, mobility-limited).\n   - Accessibility matrix for each candidate site: ADA compliance, transit access, parking, access routes during flood.\n   - Priority scoring for candidate sites using weighted criteria (see site-selection criteria below).\n4. Output materials (Day 10):\n   - 1-page dashboard PDF (hotspots, top 10 candidate sites, quick stats).\n   - Ranked candidate site list (Excel/CSV) with scoring breakdown.\n   - Short methods writeup: data used, assumptions, fallback data notes.\n\nSite-selection criteria (proposed weights \u2014 adjust if City provides constraints)\n- Vulnerable population proximity (age, disability, poverty): 25%\n- Flood exposure reduction potential (ability to reduce travel/exposure): 20%\n- Accessibility (ADA, transit, road access during flood): 15%\n- Existing infrastructure condition (sanitation, electricity, HVAC): 15%\n- Feasibility (ownership, municipal control, legal constraints): 10%\n- Time-to-operational (lead time for retrofit/modules): 10%\n- Community support / equity considerations: qualitative overlay\n\nDeliverables and outputs\n- Dashboard, ranked candidates, data package with metadata, and recommended immediate interventions.\n\nB. Quick operational measures (owner: Marcos, with City contacts)\n\nObjective: Provide immediate shelter capacity and safe spaces using existing public buildings and rapid retrofits.\n\nOperational checklist (first 72 hours to 2 weeks)\n1. Activate temporary use of large, accessible public buildings (gyms, municipal auditoria, community centers, schools during non-instruction times).\n   - Minimum retrofit actions: clear signage, accessible ramps, basic sanitation, space demarcation for distancing/privacy, basic bedding and floor coverings.\n2. Pre-stage basic supplies at identified hubs in or adjacent to vulnerable neighborhoods:\n   - Bedding kits (cots + blankets), hygiene packs, PPE, portable heaters/coolers as needed, sanitation supplies.\n3. Staffing and operations:\n   - Identify staffing rosters (volunteer + municipal staff). Prepare a simple SOP for intake, registration, triage, medical needs and accommodations for mobility-limited.\n4. Accessibility and transportation:\n   - Pre-contract accessible transport (paratransit) for residents with mobility impairments; identify pickup/handoff points.\n5. Safety and infection control:\n   - Include basic infection prevention (hand sanitizer stations, signage), especially if sheltering for prolonged periods.\n6. Pre-deploy communications:\n   - Alert templates, community hotlines, shelter maps, and route guidance to be pre-drafted for activation.\n\nQuick SOP outline (shelter activation)\n- Activation trigger (threshold rainfall, flood advisory, municipal declaration)\n- Lead contact: Emergency Manager (City) + interim PM (Marcos)\n- Triage and intake steps: registration, medical needs, accessibility needs\n- Shelter operations hours and nightly capacity management\n- Demobilization and re-stocking schedule\n\nC. Shelter typologies & prototype work (owner: Oscar)\n\nObjective: Deliver three modular typologies and two retrofit kits with one-pager sheets, 2\u20133 thumbnails each, full BOMs, cost ranges and lead-time flags.\n\nDeliverables (by Day 10)\n- Three modular typologies: Type A (Short-stay modular pods for low-cost rapid deployment), Type B (Medium-capacity modular pods with enclosed sleeping areas), Type C (Durable community modular shelter units with climate control).\n- Two retrofit kits: Retrofit Kit 1 (Minimal rapid retrofit for gyms/schools) and Retrofit Kit 2 (Advanced retrofit with partitioning, improved sanitation, accessibility ramps).\n- For each: one-pager, 2\u20133 thumbnails, detailed BOM, installation footprint, electricity and sanitation needs, rough lifecycle cost ranges, and lead time classification.\n\nLead-time classification (label all items):\n- Short (0\u20136 weeks) \u2014 items commonly available from national distributors or local suppliers.\n- Medium (6\u201312 weeks) \u2014 items requiring custom orders or limited manufacturing.\n- Long (>12 weeks) \u2014 bespoke structures, large-volume orders, or items requiring extensive permitting.\n\nQuality/safety requirements\n- Minimum ventilation and HVAC guidance for enclosed spaces.\n- ADA requirements: ramp gradients, circulation spaces, toilet access.\n- Fire safety: egress routes, number of exits, portable fire-fighting equipment.\n\nD. Finance & eligibility modelling (owner: Alex)\n\nObjective: Rapid municipal finance model to estimate capital and operating costs, map costs to FEMA-eligible line items, and provide cost ranges for typologies and retrofits.\n\nDeliverables\n- Rapid finance spreadsheet (low/mid/high scenarios) covering:\n  - Capital costs: modular purchases, retrofit materials, one-time site work.\n  - Operating costs: staff, utilities, maintenance for the projected operational period (assume initial 6-month horizon).\n  - FEMA-eligibility mapping: which cost items are likely FEMA-eligible (e.g., emergency repairs, temporary facilities) vs. municipal match requirements.\n- Short narrative on funding gap and suggested municipal match strategies (in-kind labor, municipal materials, volunteer mobilization).\n\nWorked example (sample numbers \u2014 to be refined)\n- Example: Retrofit Kit 1 applied to 3 gym sites\n  - Capital per site: $18,000 \u2014 includes partitions, portable toilets (2), ADA ramp, signage, basic bedding.\n  - Operating (6 months): $9,000 per site \u2014 staffing, utilities, supplies.\n  - Total per site: $27,000\n  - For 3 sites: $81,000\n- Example: Modular Type A (10 pods)\n  - Capital: $6,000 per pod (short-lead solution) = $60,000\n  - Shipping & installation: $10,000\n  - Operating (6 months): $12,000\n  - Total: $82,000\n\nE. Procurement and supply-chain actions (owner: Marcos / Oscar)\n\nActions\n- Immediately identify local/regional suppliers for short-lead components. Create a prioritized vendor list (national distributors for urgent items, local manufacturers for medium-term).\n- Identify emergency procurement pathways with City Procurement and Grants Officer (pre-approved vendors, sole-source justifications, cooperative purchasing agreements).\n- Prepare a draft procurement package (SOW + sample PO) for short-lead items to accelerate contracting upon City approval.\n\n---\n\n5. FEMA grant submission approach (owner: Marcos; support: Lisa & Alex)\n\nObjective: Prepare a competitive FEMA application emphasizing equity, vulnerability reduction, short lead time, and rapid deployability.\n\nStrategy and narrative outline\n- Cover letter: municipal commitment, high-level summary of need, and intended use of funds.\n- Technical narrative: present diagnostic findings (hotspots), prioritized sites, expected reductions in exposure for vulnerable populations, and operational plan for shelters.\n- Cost appendices: detailed cost estimates for each intervention (Alex).\n- Site maps: preferred shapefiles or fallback coordinate maps (Lisa).\n- Letters of support / municipal commitment: Mayor, Emergency Manager, School District, Community Organizations (draft templates in Appendix D).\n\nMapping to FEMA scoring\n- Demonstrate: (1) risk reduction (measurable reduction in exposure or improved capacity) (2) operational readiness (supply chain, procurement plan) (3) equity (priority to high-vulnerability neighborhoods) (4) cost-effectiveness (low capex per sheltered person) (5) partnerships & municipal commitment (letters).\n- Provide explicit mapping table that references each scoring criterion and where in the application evidence can be found.\n\nRequired attachments (typical \u2014 confirm with City Grants Officer and FEMA rubric)\n- Technical narrative and project description\n- Cost estimate spreadsheet and supporting quotes/pro-forma invoices\n- Site maps and photos\n- Letters of support and municipal resolutions/commitments\n- Project schedule / milestones (this timeline)\n- Procurement plan and vendor lists\n- Environmental & historical preservation compliance statements (as applicable)\n\nDeliverable timeline\n- Week 3: Draft technical narrative & cost appendices\n- Week 4: Draft client report & internal review\n- Week 5: Finalize grant package and obtain City sign-offs\n- Week 6: Submission\n\nScoring-focused attachments to prioritize\n- Evidence of vulnerability reduction: maps showing populations served within 1 mile of sites, before/after capacity calculations.\n- Short-lead procurement plan: vendor quotes/letters of intent for items within 0\u20136 weeks.\n- Equity-focused letters: statements from community organizations representing seniors, disability advocates.\n\n---\n\n6.

Immediate next actions are critical: Lisa to send the data request, Alex to confirm availability, Oscar to start typology sketches, and Marcos to confirm PM role and engage municipal contacts.\n\nThis initial report and timeline are designed to produce actionable recommendations and a FEMA-eligible grant package within the 6-week constraint. Please confirm role acceptances and reply to the data request at your earliest convenience so we can start the diagnostic pipeline.\n\nPrepared by:  \nLisa Carter  \nData Scientist, Wild Advice Partners  \nLead: Analytics & Report Author\n\n(Contact list and signature block to be appended once City and team confirmations are received.)",
